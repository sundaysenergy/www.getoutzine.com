<p>Let the love, the best method is the selection of a suitable object. A truly worthy of your love, and also know how to love you, love will naturally become simple. Lover of bad quality, and your life will be made a mess. - Inscription</p>
<p>Although she has a stable and warm love, but often is mistaken for a single in the emotional world falling behind. "Unfortunately, such a good woman like you are still a person, like what kind of object, want me to introduce you?" Similar concern, and from time to <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/peyton-manning-jersey-c-16.html">Peyton Manning Youth Jersey</a> time in the mouth of the elders, supervisor or colleagues, made her ridiculous .</p>
<p>"I have a very good boyfriend!" She is very natural. "Really, how have never heard you mentioned?" Ah? Then you often work overtime, he will not complain! "Do you often go out to play with us, he will not be angry!" And his feelings, this will not be very cool it. "... relatives and friends in this matter the response, also pointed out that a modern love a lot of blind spots - Is the so-called" love "is to readily demonstrated Ganchangcunduan the busy off their feet, or greasy Rujiaosiqi,? Or to show the new buy designer handbags, at every turn in the human predecessors out swagger it?</p>
<p>Him and her this feeling, not <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/philip-rivers-jersey-c-17.html">Philip Rivers Youth Jersey</a> each other's first love. Each even after the storms. Meet a corner in your life, they have to know the true appearance of happiness, in fact, is: simple.</p>
<p>"Do not worry about it! We get along well and trust each other, but also give each other enough space, no matter how busy I am, or go out to play with which colleagues and friends, he was very relieved." She has no intention excuse, so spoke easily .</p>
<p>Her past romances, there have been such a situation: suddenly can not find each other, the phone rang forever. The poorly demarcated communication or quarrel dialogue will always be difficult to sleep at night, the struggle was more long ...... look back at those days, love actually is so complicated, so difficult.</p>
<p>Now, and his time together, it is so simple. Weekdays busy with their own, sometimes SMS or e-mail greetings <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/ray-lewis-jersey-c-18.html">Ray Lewis Youth Jersey</a> homemade. Because understanding and understanding, the two sides do not have much to look forward to the pressure, every contact or get along with all joy as a natural gift gift. Even if only two people to the outskirts, sitting on the grass watching cloud hair, even the word did not say, you can freely enjoy the happy time.</p>
<p>Original experience of love, there are different levels in the process: "The mountain is the mountain," the mountain is not mountain "" the mountain is a mountain. Complex and difficult, sometimes mind, sometimes the appearance, sometimes skills. For example: If you do not understand each other, he just want to communicate with the other ideas too complex, the induction of the soul is difficult. Another example: care too much about the the overcritical evaluation of others, often we forget to use the most appropriate way to pay, to interact with each other way too complex mode becomes difficult to get along with. Another possibility: happiness asking too much, and did not know what they really want, and do not know how to choose, the complexity of the pursuit of happiness, the road to reach the door of happiness filled difficult.</p>
<p>Let the love, the best method is the selection of a suitable object. A truly worthy of your love, and also know how to love you, love will naturally become simple.</p>
<p>You no longer need to guess his mind, and also do not have to worry about his whereabouts. You do <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/ray-rice-jersey-c-19.html">Ray Rice Youth Jersey</a> not have to be afraid and perhaps unintentionally angered him, do not doubt his motivation to do anything. Between you, a little worried, but not to the degree of entanglement. Between you miss the point, but not to the point of sad. Between you, there is little to rely on, but not to rely on each other to embarrass "you do not as I will, I would die for you to see!"</p>
<p>Simple love, like the best quality of cosmetic products, the ingredients are natural, the effect is very delicate. It gives you nutrients and beautiful, but not make you feel a lot of trouble, your life will not be thrown into confusion.</p>
<p>Relatively simple, but also is a very objective criteria of the quality of love. Whatever makes you feel complicated or hard feelings, no matter who he is, how good conditions are not suitable to be a delay, we're in love<br />
At that time, she had just graduated from nursing school, students <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/robert-griffin-iii-jersey-c-22.html">Robert Griffin III Youth Jersey</a> bright eyes and white teeth, she was convinced that he was wearing a glass slipper, girl sitting pumpkin car so inevitably some Xingaoqiao. Chosen not know the depth of the interns in love with her, chasing her daily. She also likes to see that interns the Asahi like smile, which makes her the hearts of sweet. Can only make her feel regret, interns from a remote mountain village, her romance is very funny in the face of the reality of his total.</p>
<p>February 14 is Valentine's Day, they went to a coffee shop. She coincided with the monthly routine of "exceptional circumstances", so I am a bit lackadaisical. He said to give her a special gift, which makes her very curious.</p>
<p>The waitress asked them to drink what he imagined to point her a cup of tea roses. The exquisite cup floating Jiduo, dry roses, petals pink light glowing in the water, she put that cup, and a rich aroma blowing. "Are you in the end to give me anything?" She directly asked him. He could get a bit shy, hesitated, stammered: "...... this cup of tea ... you drink it like a lifetime it?" Meng heard the answer, she was secretly a bit disappointed that they did not hear him behind the words . But a cup of tea! She did not know why he always with her glass slipper, pumpkin car dream so far? Her goods a tea and some actually slightly sour.</p>
<p>"You want my graduation to stay in this?" He asked full of hope. "What? ... Of course." She thought their companions may be surrounded by roses, chocolates, the answer's a bit absent-minded. He looked at her a little disappointed, did not say anything. From that day on, the interns are no longer looking for <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/reggie-bush-jersey-c-20.html">Reggie Bush Youth Jersey</a> her, just looked at her, looked at her departure. She would like to ask him how he can worry about losing the girl's modesty. "Anyway, people chasing me and more of it." She consoled himself. Interns from the hospital the day to give her a call: "I may not be the best, I love very plain." She stood at the window watching he got into the car, looked at him looked toward their own, can be is endured not go. Car, her tears fell down, "actually, I just like you." She said gently in the heart.</p>
<p>Fast forward three years later, time enough can be rubbed off all the memories. She became very quiet, realistic. She has a boyfriend, tall, very uncertain laugh. He loved her, care for her all. Knowing month she met a total pain in the "special circumstances" tough battle, and looked for the traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions for her medical treatment, bowls with a deep love in his concoction made her feel satisfied. She thought: love the presence of the prince, Cinderella hope to be there for the love of an extraordinary woman.</p>
<p>One day, she had just the door to smell the aroma of a rich, that aroma as if from the depths of her memory. Pushed open the kitchen door, the boyfriend is boil a pot of tea, the water several flower tumbling roses, dried petals pink <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/rob-gronkowski-jersey-c-21.html">Rob Gronkowski Youth Jersey</a> light glowing in the water. Is the tea roses! "This is ..." she hesitated. "Loss or nurse it, it do not know?" Boyfriend smiles said: "Rose tea has the effect of relieving pain, there is an individual named Sweetie!" Menstruation pain? ...... Passion Sweetie? ... I really do not know ... "Suddenly, memories flood my heart, that Asahi-like smile and soulful voice again and again in front:" Are you willing to drink it life? "original Love has long had coming, think she was the most romantic to her and do not understand the romantic and easily discarded it. Interns that he may not be the best, his love is very simple.</p>
