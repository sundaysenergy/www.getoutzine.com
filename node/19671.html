<p>25-year-old, I graduated from college, an administrative unit to work in his home county. The unit is also a good time at the best age. Just arrived in the unit soon, there are a lot of big sister sister at her door to me to introduce object. In my eyes, being with a blind date is a very funny thing. Their kindness, I took smiled and declined. The prince of my dreams, what need others for me to choose it.</p>
<p>    He is in my 25-year-old that year into my life. Is funny is <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/new-england-patriots-rob-gronkowski-jersey-c-375_402.html">Rob Gronkowski Jersey</a> turned Meishuozhiyan. To introduce him to my big sister, a flak he boasted: military cadres, undergraduate diploma, good character ... really, even if this meant he had no amount of good, and only one, enough so that I do not consider him, that is his career - soldier. My neighbors brother is also a member of the military, the plight of the sister-in-law, I have seen with my own eyes, never married soldiers swear married, afraid that they can not afford the title of "Army Wives" that heavy. I brought up some squeamish, the 24-year-old is still like a child. Reply matchmaker very simply: do not look, do not marry a soldier! Sister who is very stubborn and refused to agree to look at and how multiple friends Okay. Is also, anyway, does not intend to marry him.</p>
<p>    Carelessly, not dressing did not carefully chosen clothes. The river in early spring, there is a very strong coolness far to see him in the river, and turn to a camouflage. This guy, actually, so casually come, coveralls civilian clothes did not <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/new-england-patriots-wes-welker-jersey-c-375_399.html">Wes Welker Jersey</a> change. Looked at his own disgraced dressed, I have some unconvinced, wanted to tease him about. Maybe because when I found myself without any pressure, we are talking about very freely. Imagine that he turned straight to the point, straight to the point, say marry our soldiers but bitter to pay a lot, to be faced with a lot of sacrifice. Say, you are so young do not need to choose to do the soldier's wife. I only listen to parts Deva kings casually promised, when I say you want to marry a soldier? I was attracted to him talk about those topics, and those are in fact, he was talking about a very real problem. He is an honest man.</p>
<p>    Time, even unknowingly quietly glide over two hours, the delay can not <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/new-york-giants-hakeem-nicks-jersey-c-433_457.html">Hakeem Nicks Jersey</a> be the end of the original ten minutes of blind dating, I stood with sore legs, with each other, but still did not mean to be away.</p>
<p>    I'm a little tired, you can sit down and say what? Yuehua Jian, I sit on a long stone bench go out into the river.</p>
<p>   "And so on, this stool is too cold, you girls afraid of cold pad my gloves." Perhaps he did not think about what that arbitrary action, not the slightest deliberately show mean, but Barbara I heart set off a sort of a small ripple.</p>
<p>    Can not say to the little details, we decided we love, but that little detail we love, but opened the prelude. Nuances to see the truth, I stubbornly convinced that he can give happiness I want.</p>
<p>Every parting, are get together to start a new one</p>
<p>    Lightning fell in love with him, and the hundreds of letters of fiery letters, a bright flowery love road paved. From love to marriage, everything like in a dream for him, I turned out to be no turning back, the eyes no other landscape. At that time, there are really <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/new-york-giants-jason-pierrepaul-jersey-c-433_459.html">Jason Pierre-Paul Jersey</a> a lot of people do not understand me, do not understand a young female college students, why must marry a soldier, to endure the bitter share of both Acacia. They warned me, married, will know a taste.</p>
<p>    Was really young, head full of romantic love, and do not even want future.</p>
<p>    Parting, and soon became the first lesson of my marriage. The marriage leave Hugh Ends he returns, I remain in the original work. The little station platform, a taste for the first time with his other love. The car did not arrive, the first tears flow. He kept weeping for me, that is a start to freak out. I know he Jiangyanhuanxiao. Vertical and there is no amount of dismay, my eyes, or pull live the footsteps of his long journey. <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/new-york-giants-victor-cruz-jersey-c-433_454.html">Victor Cruz Jersey</a> Yes, he said, the pair that is only a start. Later, when again and again the same parting Advent, I learned with him, smiling, turned to tears, and then frantically thrown into the bottom of my heart. Our hearts are the same, and do not want to make love with a worried about the road.</p>
<p>    My love, my own way, I am willing choice, so I will not cry. There are too many people, the parting as a kind of melancholy, parting the spectrum into a sad song, I put every parting, as the next get together to start. Sending the line, we smiled and waved goodbye, he said, you finally too big. Yes, in order to love him, I had to learn to grow up.</p>
<p>A human gestation, the happiness of two people</p>
<p>   Now walking on the road, often see potbellied expectant mothers, happy face smiling bloom in the company of her husband's arm. I still feel the slightest regret, he said, on the day you do not have such accompany me. Really, when he returns I still slim bride, he does come back, I have a crescent fresh daughter handed his hands.</p>
<p>    Pregnancy, childbirth, a woman 's life is the happiest and most painful greatest fear. <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/seattle-seahawks-russell-wilson-jersey-c-627_630.html">Russell Wilson Jersey</a> I was pregnant, the unborn child seems particularly do not receive my love has been frustrating me. Five or six months caw spit, eat things just were born from the stomach. While I go to work, while taking care of themselves and the child in the stomach, and learn to cook, says with a reasonable, not afraid loss themselves, but not neglect our children. Every time they eat on the spit, and then eat, sandwiched tears down the pharynx, poor colleague Sister tears that I created for itself.</p>
<p>It looks like my parenting correspondence, or day by day sent to distant. Unborn fetus, one grew up, he could not taste will be a father surprises, I put that little written in a diary written letter. Month, I need something badly, there is no other feeling; two months, I feel the intraabdominal like have a small pears; four months old when I told him belly like a little fish in moving it; six months, I sent him a photo green willow tree, I proudly smiled happily belly .... He wrote back and said I seemed to see a piece of my belly and lovely fish.</p>
<p>    I took to bed capacity, he is the anti-flood frontline mud water carry sandbags. In 1998, the Yangtze River basin, flooding, he spent more than 70 days and nights in the anti-flood embankment. Call me, I am sorry to say I can not accompany the production, I am sorry I. I told him, my brave yet, and worry. In fact, I'm really afraid to put down his phone, my tears fell.</p>
<p>    A delivery room with me, happens to be my junior high school students, she was yelling, her husband out in a rash, I may envy. She envy asked me if I did not hurt. I did not utter a word, turned to face the other side. Standing beside two tears in the bark of the <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/tennessee-titans-chris-johnson-jersey-c-680_685.html">Chris Johnson Jersey</a> mother - his mother and my mother. I can not let them distressed anxious. Cord around the neck a little before the child is born, the doctor said I'm the best point force can be used, or may cause the child choking. Really put force feeding have to spend, which control the kind of torn really hurt. The birth of a child, and her daughter safe. I phoned him in the past, he went to the dam to view the regimen.</p>
<p>    Whole bred production process, I did not even hum loudly did not shed a tear. Even my mother think that's incredible. That timid and squeamish's daughter, when became so strong. In fact, the mother does not know, my tears, and end up with a mess that a late night. It is in the anti-flood embankment, one holding a child, like I went to visit her husband Junsao fondly sing again marched to the flood-fighting frontline husband and his comrades: really miss you, I call in the night, the dawn ... ...</p>
<p>    That night, cried my eyes red. That night, he was still the same levee on the go. I never think he looks like.</p>
<p>Because I love you, I became extremely brave</p>
<p>    Kind of poly far more than the day lasted as much as five years, the sixth year of marriage, I handle the forces of the army procedures followed him.</p>
<p>    The trivial days of daily necessities, but also filled with a deep sense of <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/washington-redskins-robert-griffin-iii-jersey-c-697_698.html">Robert Griffin III Jersey</a> pyrotechnics taste. Unfamiliar, much suited to first time away from home, also once let me and he quarrel over, but it is only a day small episode only. More often, we cherish to spend a share of the hard-won. "You leave their homes and followed me to come here, I do not pamper you which." He told me about the most nauseating much better than this from the heart, made me feel sweet. He was to do so, usually do not work, always rushing to make things well. He is very capable, what almost all home less worry about me. Slowly and become married to the way it was before, a little squeamish, a little fragile, always feel that he, my world will be an Enron.</p>
<p>    Childhood is very timid, never love to Zhaoreshifei. That time, the non-provoke us. The streets, I was free to look at the clothes with him, his eyes straight out in front. He tried to stopped him and saw that he had clinched the front of the hand of <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/san-diego-chargers-philip-rivers-jersey-c-563_568.html">Philip Rivers Jersey</a> a young man, a thief is to steal, he caught. I was going forward, the scene in front of, but I became petrified, four or five long-haired troll knife wielding shiny balls surrounded. He also spent, I do not know how to respond. My throat was tight, fat ignorant mind, heart is going. Passers-by line in a hurry, it seems that no one noticed them. They are still approaching his, Luanhui knives seeing on the program to him, I rushed forward, how exhausted his life efforts to issue the sound Duanhe, I do not know. He said that I rushed the family to stay in front of those, a loud shout: "Do you want to do, but also anti-you know we do not?" Surprise ending appears, they looked at each other, closing with a knife, in disgrace , dropped an unlucky encounter plainclothes. I mistaken plainclothes.</p>
<p>    Watching them run away, looked at him standing in front of me safe and sound. My legs no longer lose control, squatted limply tears streaming down down refers to Fenger. He took hold of me and said all right all right, how do you like this occur, I frightened. I said I was scared out of ideas, and you are left with the natural mind.</p>
<p>    If not that small accident, I do not believe, what love can be called a common <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/new-york-giants-eli-manning-jersey-c-433_434.html">Eli Manning Jersey</a> destiny Shengsixiangxu. To love, and then a timid person may become warriors. From the daughter of a delicate and fragile, grow into a strong and brave soldier wife, and along the way hard, only I know, all the way to the happiness joy, I also realize that most real.
