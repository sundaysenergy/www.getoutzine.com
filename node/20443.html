<p>March 1, 2009, and corn held in Singapore in a simple and solemn ceremony, the marriage notary, when I face the notary public, say "I do" three words, happiness is like a merry tune, I heart Yang Kai. We have planned a June weddings in corn home in Yichang, alma mater humanities Philharmonic Choir and invited more than 40 partners, we sing the prelude to marriage.</p>
<p>Chorus lasting bonds</p>
<p>A cappella is a unique form of music, it <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/aj-green-jersey-c-1.html">A.J. Green Youth Jersey</a> is not combined with any musical instrument, only employing sound as a performance tool, but than people imagine, not only on the performance of the human voice can imitate musical instruments, the rich sound of nature, more profound , more sincere, more natural style display of musical works and deep meaning.</p>
<p>In September 2003, I became Wuhan Luojia of Yamashita a beautiful University freshmen associations to recruit new, I did not hesitate to choose the humanities Philharmonic Chorus. The parents named me "Braun" is the hope I have musical lark singing, and I was raised the system hard music training. Cappella choir proposition philosophy, and all of a sudden attracted me.</p>
<p>Most of the choir members, some foundation, but the original practice solo, suddenly Chorus Line, audible breath singing skills, expressions are not suited to some. Like my original practice of folk singing, the sound characteristics, <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/aaron-rodgers-jersey-c-2.html">Aaron Rodgers Youth Jersey</a> and the emphasis is perfect echo of the sound between chorus can not let a person's voice alone highlights. Directed to the old head of the study, said his "revolutionary comrades a brick, where need where to move", the range is very wide, not only men whispered "Subwoofer" men loudly Ministry harness well The tone is smooth and simple, and very easy integration. The legend is very powerful brothers, is corn.</p>
<p>First saw him, unlike most the music talented students is so arrogant, but very restrained. The lively atmosphere choir, my cheerful and generous, and soon into one and began headed. Companion joked We are with are Aries, has its eye teeth, love to sing, are head of. At that time I did not personally, but especially look forward to the weekly rehearsals, sometimes also Taitailielie to cater to joke, "but also to see corn brother, oh so happy!"</p>
<p>May 22, 2004, organized by the choir concert. I overheard farewell corn and a few old students, said he faced graduate,<a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/andre-johnson-jersey-c-3.html">Andre Johnson Youth Jersey</a>  intends to eleven to go to Shanghai. I was heart of a tight first thought was, no, I do not want to let him go, I do not want to see him later.</p>
<p>Now that I think surprised at the firm. That night I added his QQ, start with the choir chatted about music, school, movies, so chat away. He actually quite Nengkan to, not only a lot of my insights similar to speak also particularly humorous, I giggle to the middle of the night at the screen. After a month, every night I have waited for him on the line, to see his picture is dark, turn anxious in the bedroom, round and round.</p>
<p>His time to part-time at Computer City, I deliberately ran to buy U disk, boss I said, "I know, you're Braun, corn mentioned that you say that you are a true lark," I thought to myself Me , happy.</p>
<p>June 28, we went to the station graduation old students, he also mentions his eleven go of things, so I am determined to pick out. Back at night, I hinted that he had something to say. He said would have guessed that a little, but not sure. So to catch a few minutes dodge, direct knock the last four words: "I like you!" The silence of his time than I imagined shorter screen to jump out immediately, replies: "Very happy ah!" He has also been feeling, and we began to meet up.</p>
<p>That summer time like brisk Serenade, joyous and <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/andrew-luck-jersey-c-4.html">Andrew Luck Youth Jersey</a>  short-lived, in the twilight of his bike slid down a long ramp to pick me up in the bedroom downstairs, and then with a walk in the campus.</p>
<p>During November, his father's car to pick us back to Yichang, more than four hours away, we laugh all the way all the way song, sang from his father when he was young, "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" sang, the latest pop music has been sung. After that, his parents and I get along very well.</p>
<p>Timbre run-in</p>
<p>Cappella composed by many singers, not only require that each singer has a beautiful tone, but also requires a high degree of harmony singer, timbre interacting with each other, and we can not just sing their own parts, but also, to listen and with the part of others, so as to achieve the wonderful sounds of nature realm.</p>
<p>According to plan, the <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/antonio-brown-jersey-c-5.html">Antonio Brown Youth Jersey</a> corn in October to go to Shanghai to find a job, we began a discordant note.</p>
<p>To Shanghai, his work has been unstable, and found some not only hard, and there is no room for development, income is not high. Then I think that unfortunately, why someone else's boyfriend in the side, but I love and a touch less than the shadow of the feelings, the future is very misty.</p>
<p>The Corn want a lot of ways to strengthen confidence, insist on daily phone calls, send text messages, chat, often to my order flowers, send gifts. In April 2005, I strive to a Fudan meeting, opportunities, and the way to see him. Just three days later, when I say goodbye sad, he comforted me said, "Nothing will soon be able goodbye." At that time I did not think about. Back to Wuhan, the next day, they received his message, said to send a gift to his students that I'm going to get. Qiaokai Men, he suddenly jumped from behind the door, and my joy is called and jump.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2006, we almost broke up. Then the corn to get the opportunity to go to work in Singapore. When he told me, I think he is a notification tone, rather than to discuss with me the feeling of not being respected and valued makes me very angry, and can not understand his reasons. He said this is for our future, in order to give me a more stable environment. I'm breaking up with him, "You want to go, is not for me, not for us."</p>
<p>Eventually let me agree with him out him an e-mail, "There is no perfect person or thing does not make money, job insecurity in Shanghai, Singapore and too far away but not perfect can be overcome, can even be acceptable enjoy, like singing, like a person's tone no matter how good, can not cover all the range, as long as we fit well, and will be able to create a broader, deeper, more pleasant work. "</p>
<p>After going abroad, often need to work overtime, corn every day and I no telephone in the house, after work and then later he would chat <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/ben-roethlisberger-jersey-c-6.html">Ben Roethlisberger Youth Jersey</a> with me in public phone booths outside. Fun, call me cheaper than playing in Shanghai from Singapore.</p>
<p>In September 2006, my senior standing Kaoyan security research abroad fork in the road, very confused and do not know where to go, what to do. Feelings, I hold a negative attitude, do not want to do any effort. Upset when I rushed him angry, "you're like Singapore, hanging around and do not come back, no matter what I did!" He does not always gas is not angry, this section of the difficulty is a bit big, we sang slowly, slowly row it really good? Actually, I really do not have a special favor to Singapore, where you can just give us a better future. "He always has a magic power, whether I bother, let me slowly calmed down and accept his optimism and confidence.</p>
<p>Discuss about it, we have decided, my first stay in Wuhan reading Master say.</p>
<p>Huazhang into the early</p>
<p>The human voice is the most beautiful sound in the world. A cappella can give full play to the men and women of different voices, sound area, the timbre of expressive, unified style, to show the ultimate beauty of the human voice.</p>
<p>The past two years, every spring he would <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/calvin-johnson-jersey-c-7.html">Calvin Johnson Youth Jersey</a> leave home, to accompany me to see the cherry blossoms, birthday. Later I learned that his leave of absence in fact very difficult, not just under a lot of pressure off leave have to add a lot of class.</p>
<p>The summer of 2008, I went to see him in Singapore. Singapore is very beautiful and clean, but the moment I can not produce a sense of familiarity and belonging. I do not think it is drifting and find the feeling of home, he deliberately changed rented a big house, the master bedroom, the surrounding environment is very good and the landlord also very good. Before in order to save money, he has always been and colleagues shared a cheaper house.</p>
<p>For some time, I really appreciate his daily morning to evening how hard nine in the morning to go to work, generally to be back before nine p.m., eleven, twelve, is often the case, also no overtime pay . Although usually serious lack of sleep, but the corn or a time to accompany me to go out and play. One day, we encounter on the streets of his investment managers, he praised the corn, "This guy is good, Singapore began a month do fixed  <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/cam-newton-jersey-c-8.html">Cam Newton Youth Jersey</a> investment that you will save money you looking for him to really find the right ! "At this time, I did not really understand the pains taken by him to Singapore, he is not said than sing nicely, but secretly trying to hard in the heart.</p>
<p>After that, I no longer complain that he went to Singapore, do not complain that he was always busy, do not complain that he did not have time to accompany me. Our feelings, slide smoothly into the next section. In fact, before and did not deliberately plan when love when to get married, so naturally, can be said to be a natural. I now also faced with the choice of where to find what, the more experience he's not easy. Although the future is still uncertain, but I do not have a little anxiety, mood is very smooth and very satisfied. Now we feel that, in fact, to stay in Singapore or returning, it is not the most important, the important thing is that the two of us together, work hard together for the future, and enjoy the happiness hardship together</p>
