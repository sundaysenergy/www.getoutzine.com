<p>Zen always comprehend the meantime the rivers and mountains of the reciprocating is about given up and must pass through before the earthly suffering. The Red Buddha called lofty place, but there is always a glamorous luster shaking Yi <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/roddy-white-jersey-c-23.html">Roddy White Youth Jersey</a> between mortal people love and hate, and sorrow and delighted. Buddha: the common people is difficult to cross.</p>
<p>Suigetsu asked, flowers in a mirror, and you say what is the beam glowed exquisite brilliance? Flowers in a mirror seems to be some answer to my question, she said, anywhere.</p>
<p>I again and again patiently looked full of Zen Q, trying to find out the crux of all the problems between you <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/russell-wilson-jersey-c-24.html">Russell Wilson Youth Jersey</a> and I, but found nothing, and ultimately had to face the upcoming parting smile, bit climb a thousand mountains million water smile can not re-integration after arrival, and had lost the original sweet breath. How much peter earthly love, the so-called causal Who wrong what is it?</p>
<p>Since after all, is to get the <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/tim-tebow-jersey-c-25.html">Tim Tebow Youth Jersey</a> job, then the story of men and women, no matter what face appears, will be doomed to sorrow in this Red secular, this sad eye pupil straight piercing the pit of the stomach, people a long time, a long time can not be relieved.</p>
<p>Flowers in a mirror and moon in the water, or you and me, or loneliness and solitude.</p>
<p>Lie, Lie cold in the snow-covered plateau, you abide by their own choice, and this option is said to come from the ideal, and a need for precipitation, distant it is also in close proximity to look at you, look at you sounding reason behind <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/tom-brady-jersey-c-26.html">Tom Brady Youth Jersey</a> doped with a trace of escape. Straight into the sky that you own youth from the paradise very close from the Buddha about is also very close. One day you say, you vowed to Buddha, and hope that your presence can bring me happy. I remember when I smiled, this operator is not happy drip? Or my appearance can troubleshoot your loneliness, away from the loneliness of the Red.</p>
<p>Buddha said: everyone can see encountered already arranged all edge. Origin edge to make poly edge casual, all providence. Flowers in a mirror and moon in the water baffled that we're alive, what is there to do? Any efforts are in vain, God willing, arrange everything. So Buddha of compassion to lend a hand of salvation, the sound of a hollow voice urn gas honest, you go into your retirement simply your choice, this idea away enough to decide <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/tony-gonzalez-jersey-c-27.html">Tony Gonzalez Youth Jersey</a> you seen encountered, so that in the final analysis you have seen encountered or grasp by itself.</p>
<p>Multi-contradictions in the world, but there are still more than love contradictory things, how much some incredible people. So I tried to resolve this contradiction He contradiction want to find out so you will always love my weapon, rather than final leave time, such as running water, flowers in a mirror struggling to retain Suigetsu void struggling to retain void. Mind your initial affectionate repeatedly to prove that you have given me this earthly warmest feelings. You say you come from downtown in the future or back to downtown. Noisy prosperity, the city where Tuibeihuanzhan the circulation in the hokey above the surface glitz, those who burn do <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/tony-romo-jersey-c-28.html">Tony Romo Youth Jersey</a> your internal organs of the bonds of this world to make you feel an indescribable emotions, restless or unlimited emptiness is not the end of life, but it is the end of survival.</p>
<p>You and I say it all the time, you people have long away from downtown, the meaning of existence in the the frontier hill and dale deserted experience. For life, whether this is also a kind of performance art? Gain and loss will always be difficult to identify, it is difficult to distinguish. Phone, you often have to take a deep breath, the thin oxygen, it is probably an edge of human survival, a survival of the critical point. Is such a most unsuitable place to live, more people came to realize that the survival of the sense, the world is very strange, people have nothing to say.</p>
<p>Most of the time your tone calm and open-minded, you hearty laughter and bright and clean, but when you talk about death, the heavy suffocating, you said that you had seen a man is a flu kills young lives, who can think the plains did little cold <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/torrey-smith-jersey-c-29.html">Torrey Smith Youth Jersey</a> this mortal danger in the highlands; You said a few days ago was met, and even laughter not cleared, already Soul Heaven That's not fair? Is one such place, death is so easy to come could have passed, maybe sit face-to-face. Although I have not faced such a harsh environment, but I have to face death, so I can understand how you feel, but I do not know what to say, cause and effect can not explain the fate of the face, I'm speechless, only silence appease your sentimental melancholy appease you powerless in the face of death. I know that you need more one to rely on, even if the shoulder is weak, but also be able to draw some strength and quiet in this weak. I have always believed, quiet woman owned, although invisible, but rain is immortal, wind lingers. I rely on forward, has been standing far off, or the root of your disappointment, your disappointment let you no effort to maintain this love Crystal, a direct result of my disappointment due to If everything is doomed.</p>
<p>From love to hate and hate to all was quiet, seems impossible to determine the pros and cons of the process, you can use a few days to a few months, or even years in the love-hate torture yourself calm but in an accidental the moment comes, or an <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/troy-polamalu-jersey-c-30.html">Troy Polamalu Youth Jersey</a> epiphany. All the sorrows and joys by heart. When your heart, love and hate, your eyes must be tossing the topsy-turvy world, is not nothing calm after the fact, what is there, what is free? But vary your perspective.</p>
<p>Flowers in a mirror can not help crying, she said, Moon Water, No, not you, I can not live. Of course, the moon in the water can not hear, and this time he spent thousands of miles away from the mirror place to eat, drink romantic re-fall into the lofty world of mortals, saw him say his appearance in high spirits hidden trace conceal his fatigue, his poise, his erudition, his generosity, his generosity, but alone, this lonely two words deeply hurt the heart of the flowers in a mirror, but not entitled to share the the Suigetsu heart of world. Flowers in a mirror from lonely to worry about, to be afraid, to sad, to the haggard, which is about the inevitable erosion of waiting. Or the Suigetsu occasionally think of flowers in a mirror, this two how people know how to protect themselves, sealed from the bottom of my heart for all the emotion, to sound calm lied to each other, and had lied to their own.</p>
<p>The usual window have Plum will be different. Buddha, what does that mean? The wordless Buddha, Buddha Xinruzhishui. The same sentence, but can only be sensed unlimited sad. In fact, in this rapidly changing world, this should not gonna live <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/victor-cruz-jersey-c-31.html">Victor Cruz Youth Jersey</a> forever. Buddha, you do not love it? Buddha smiling, extremely kind, and that smile as accommodate hundreds of rivers, seawater, bottomless. I heard that the flowers in a mirror gently, can I have a moon in the water, I really want you.</p>
<p>All the love in the world were all with the same face, half of the children suffering, half of the children is happiness. Flowers in a mirror and moon on the shadow repeatedly overlap in my body, my confusion, my heart for you, broken into two flowers in a mirror, so that to the last actually no longer distinguish what am I whom cried, I almost snatch the flowers in a mirror of the soul, always put the phone down on the distance you whispered, Suigetsu, I really miss you.</p>
<p>You inadvertently been my way, so as to achieve a pass edge to will have to go, Origin destined to do. No matter how we look back, but only in the opposite direction to the respective farther and farther. Buddha said, people should learn to let go, the more you put down, the more I have more. The truth is right, but it is difficult to do, and then broken heart, then stale wound, but insisted stop mend them, refused to discard.</p>
<p>Some of the early winter temple deserted mountain breeze biting slightest curl of incense mixed with the fresh flavor unique to the mountains enveloped the whole temple of calm and tranquility. Like the ancient temples of the courtyard, one into another into a temple of the gods in a temple, a temple incense in a temple, just the drafts stop feeding, wrapped in his coat was still shivering with cold, and had to cling to arms.</p>
<p>I decided to up the hill to the whole day dedicated think you all forget, and then down the mountain when I would like to see the Buddha when you want to see Eighteen when you think you see Avalokitesvara With that the walls of beautiful Buddhist stories surround lofty magnificence. See all the magnificent, wrinkled tight brow look blankly into the distance from the monastery window, the mountains, such as Dai, rising smoke rising to the foot of the mountain village. There is a crescent from west to east of the river, from the wind and waves, the wind stopped, the wave is like a mirror. Zhong drum came with the snow, snow ablation things in the world about are like this from scratch, from there to now.</p>
<p>Buddha, I would like to forget.</p>
<p>Forget does not mean that it never existed, a scene that everything itself comes from select, rather than deliberately. Better to let go and see the game better.</p>
<p>I began to try all suspicion and resentment, all deceived by the better nature of things discarded. This can be very hard, is tantamount to abandoning the entire love. Gradually, I found that the original only will this relationship slowly down slowly to stay out of, I can be stripped out from the memories of you all good, not all bad to obliterate had joy, even if there is to offer all kinds of the worth of the pain, after all, you have given me the most beautiful feelings. Then the earth gorgeous luster big place in front of me again Guanghua, I finally understand the whim of flowers in a mirror. When there is love in your heart, then the glory is to smile when your heart landscape, so glorious is beautiful, heart and actions, the glory comes from all hearts beautiful, or had good things short so I can not give up, so I willingly endure dark moment of brilliance was obscured.</p>
