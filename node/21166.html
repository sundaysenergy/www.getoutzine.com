<p>Just got married, he has no money, and took her to live in a dilapidated old house. She came from the northern cities, Heating habits of the northern winter house with him here, cold rooms, air leakage around, not a few days, a sick. He waited at her bedside, distressed speechless.</p>
<p>Once warm, a Baidu love her <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/peyton-manning-jersey-c-16.html">Peyton Manning Youth Jersey</a> well, he used to every night before going to bed for her end of the foot-washing water, the hot-risking water vapor, and then pulled her feet on the water, to help her wash rubbed gingerly, as if washing is not a foot, but a piece of porcelain, extremely precious porcelain. Wash her good dry, he then took off his socks, put your foot in the water the already cool off the mouth Xixi peeing said, this water can be really hot ah.</p>
<p>Winter, her weekly bath twice Wednesday and Sunday. He followed to develop this habit, and every time he insisted on the first wash, wash well then told her to go to the bathroom that day, she would like to quickly bathed watching TV, and said to him, I have to take a bath . He shook his head, no, I'm the first wash. She thought he was joking side while walking to the bathroom like a baby and said, No, I have to wash, wash well, you can watch TV. He rushed to step took her straight face, I said I would first wash! Then went back into the bathroom.</p>
<p>He never in any thing, <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/philip-rivers-jersey-c-17.html">Philip Rivers Youth Jersey</a> do not give way to her, except this time, in order to take a bath, such a tiny thing, she was in the bathroom, listening to the sound of water, grievances and cried. Day, she pouted want to go home and pack up his clothes, he Kuku Qiu her, she was determined to leave him, she said, even such a small matter do not try to please me, what good is a husband.</p>
<p>Or coax her, he promised that the next time anything so she no longer compete with her. However, after her gas gradually disappeared, he still is to her step bathe, she would not care about him, forgotten the promise precedence.</p>
<p>The transition from winter to summer, hot as the house steamer fixed will Chuyishenhan. The <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/ray-lewis-jersey-c-18.html">Ray Lewis Youth Jersey</a> longer Paojiao a bath once every night. He dawdle hand up, not to say that they watch the soccer game, that read the news, so she is always the first wash, in turn reversed the order, and every day she first wash, and only then he.</p>
<p>Later, his brother getting married, bought a house, and there is no heating, brother sister-in-law to go to the new house to see. His first state-of-the-art bathroom, looked around and said to his brother, the new house is better than the old house, no heating and not leak, but you have to remember, a woman afraid of cold winter bathing, you must first wash, washed later, the bathroom's temperature rises, I tried to at least be able to rise once it! Brother laugh, you can be really careful that summer? Summer is not necessarily to make her first wash, so cool once than after the wash? He patted his brother's shoulder, nodded.</p>
<p>He thought she did not hear the kitchen, in fact, she was heard clearly hear tears. She would like you own stupid for so many years, moved to a new house from the old house, never <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/ray-rice-jersey-c-19.html">Ray Rice Youth Jersey</a> Heating to Heating, he has maintained this habit, she was never seriously try to figure out the significance of the inside.</p>
<p>That night, her first for his side of the foot-washing water. With the new house, the feet habit but a bath every day and ignored. He fail to beat her, had no choice but to put his feet on the hot water, she washed him with rubbing his feet on the full of the hard cocoon, her fundus getting wet, he walked Road received much tired, gave her this warm home now, and she turned out to have never washed his a foot.</p>
<p>When she looked up, he only smiled and said something original, daughter-in-law to the feet so comfortable! She cried.</p>
<p>After he washed, she learned his way off the socks, put his feet on the water, but found that the water has been <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/robert-griffin-iii-jersey-c-22.html">Robert Griffin III Youth Jersey</a> cold out. It turned out that the water washed a second person wash, cool, instead of still hot.</p>
<p>She did not say it, did not bother to change the order that washed first wash, because she knows that it is his own way to give her love, real love. Winter for her growth once the summer for her less once, just once warm, but it is a Baidu love<br />
Maybe you have had a similar experience: you love someone, start kiss me, Enenaiai even feel happy to faint, but a long time, they can not help but friction and contradictions, arguing followed originally lover normal thing, but most gas you are not quarrel, but the other side of the escape, and even disappear.</p>
<p>Love to face, do not flee love we need to respect, whether it is love or not to love should be responsible for each other, this is a man's attitude, since there have <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/reggie-bush-jersey-c-20.html">Reggie Bush Youth Jersey</a> been wonderful, happy, have fun, you should always remember, The question is not who's error occurred, it is important that the two people to sit down together and calm communication. Have a slogan that good: If there is no communication, the world will be like? It shows the importance of communication.</p>
<p>Lovers' quarrels is not necessarily a bad thing, sometimes two people can understand the feelings and thoughts of the other party did not express to you in a quarrel, which is the opportunity to know each other, but the two lovers no matter how bickering remember not to go on fighting for too long, but can not trying to avoid an order to find a place to quiet you practice will make you really love to know more worried about the contradictions will intensify because there is no timely communication, which is counterproductive.</p>
<p>Said the half-day do not escape, in fact more to say everyone should cherish the present one, since you chose him do you love to pay a little more multi go considerate, less care about some. Sometimes mistaken for that because we do not have timely <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/rob-gronkowski-jersey-c-21.html">Rob Gronkowski Youth Jersey</a> expression. Two people who love to work hand in hand to the face of life will appreciate the care and love to each other, so the problem must not escape, telling myself that he is their favorite people, as long as there is love overcome all difficulties magic, hope all my friends in love often remind myself that you really want happiness.</p>
<p>Two people get along with the need to be tolerant. No matter how close their relationship, the end is to have different ideas. In this way, the conflict is in the offing. Years is the enemy of love, and love to overcome years we want is to forgive but not possess, to warmth rather than passion.</p>
<p>Love is rooted in the simple things. Natural outpouring of the kind of casual, revealed is the true meaning of love. The short-term will be very romantic, long it will bring dissatisfaction, the youth was about to lose, will not have a frustration? Love non-stop, going on forever, really, really need a lot of courage.</p>
