<p>A man sitting in the peninsula coffee, waiting for the arrival of a friend. Today's very sunny, warm but not exaggerated. I chose a position by the window, because this place is the quietest, most suitable for listening to. Friends, unharmed, <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/clay-matthews-jersey-c-9.html">Clay Matthews Youth Jersey</a> and eyes, but clearly with a little sadness. In fact, I probably know a friend invited me to the purpose: he broke up with her.</p>
<p>Love, need space and oxygen very straight to the point, he also went straight to the theme. "How do you like?" But also how to separate. "" Effort, and perhaps would be a break. "Unlikely, we are very tired. Moreover, she do not want to see me." I silent, know Zaiquan him what. I think when a woman does not want to see a man, perhaps, is in his own heart to the man sentenced to "death penalty".</p>
<p>Before you see him, I have received through her phone. Her sisters slept in my bunk bed college, and he is my best buddy child. Their union, we are a large group of friends has been the proudest achievements, their separate, we never dreamed that ending. He loved her, this is a well-known secret. A group of friends together, They Let envy is our "mock" object. We often say: "He told her, in both the father and when Damn basis, only the <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/eli-manning-jersey-c-10.html">Eli Manning Youth Jersey</a> occasional cameo boyfriend." He never bothers enjoying so, who is also the identity of the three jobs.</p>
<p>She also loves him, that no one doubts. We said she always told him, just like his shadow, inseparable. She said: "I have to let him in when I need to, I can be found at any time." We have "jealous" to tell them: "distance in order to produce the United States!" And they unanimously retorted: "We do not like, from the United States is gone. "in her phone, she was very calm told me:" If love is so tired that I would rather give up, "I asked his eyes as calm:" Why? The point of a cigarette, "he thought, suddenly aware of what he rushed cigarette stubbed out and put it back in the cigarette case.</p>
<p>"She does not <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/joe-flacco-jersey-c-11.html">Joe Flacco Youth Jersey</a>  like me smoking, especially in public places, then I do not smoke, she does not like me to play games on the Internet, saying that would Wanwusangzhi as long as she pleased, and I can not fight, because she said she will not let me do things, I do not insist, because I think she is good for me, and I respect her. Maybe she has been accustomed to this, around my life, she felt that it is the only way to fully explain her in my standing in the eyes. "So you bored? want to get rid of?" I asked him. "But how, if so, to leave her I feel relief rather than dismay."</p>
<p>Looked in front of friends, they also can not find the original expression of happiness on how thin face. I remember the last time I saw them a year ago, to celebrate the boy into a Japanese-owned company. I joke with him: "I heard that the Japanese companies are very demanding, ah, there is no time to take care of your 'baby' how to do?" He looked at her, and the two had a happy smile, nasty scold me: "less provoke! "</p>
<p>Ever since I went to a Japanese company, like a full chord, cycle to work. Her graduation went to the national authorities, working pressure and density are and we are immeasurably. To be honest, a girl find this work really happy Although the monthly salary is only half of me, but, toward the nine-to-five life, at least <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/matt-ryan-jersey-c-12.html">Matt Ryan Youth Jersey</a> 10 days a year of family leave are those of us "foreign DaGongZu," simply can not imagine 's. Many people envy our lives, says the two of us, a lot, a very homely, was a perfect match.</p>
<p>Japanese-funded enterprises, our time is not the statutory eight hours, but based on the completion of their work, overtime was commonplace. At first, she just complain that I do not have time to accompany her, but later complained that the gradual upgrade in order suspicion. Time, I have to work overtime to get home until late at night a little. A door, I saw her sitting on the bed, I asked her why she did not sleep, she was cynical that they want and so I go home and smell the body perfume. I only when they found she was joking, to undress to take a bath, washing her bed turn my pockets. I am very angry, but said nothing.</p>
<p>That night, we could not sleep. I was thinking, why she would not trust me? She might be thinking, why I would be so mind her suspicions. Woke up the next day, she has to go to work, the pillow is a letter that she left me. She said she has been a long time to feel her the kind of care, not to mention what ", who is also <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/matt-schaub-jersey-c-13.html">Matt Schaub Youth Jersey</a> three jobs. I felt a bit guilty, but helpless. The life force I had to struggle, had overdrafts like to live life. I can not like those carefree student campus, romantic but not worldly air. I can do just to earn some capital taking advantage of young, let her live a better life.</p>
<p>She began to keep in overtime gave me the phone call, play on the day and sometimes seven, eight. Later, my colleagues when I pass the phone playfully added: "Your wife and Chagang." On one occasion, I really intolerable, the tone is very hard to tell her: "I am in the unit, you can rest assured that it? '</p>
<p>This is the first time I mad at her, I did not even loud and she talked. She was angry, and I blame myself. I apologized to her, and she asked me one condition: later my phone at any time to let her check, not allowed to delete phone records. I promise, I want to consolidate our feelings, and if this can ease her suspicions, and I am willing to do so.</p>
<p>I have some doubts, remember University, the night lying about will she the language imposing will air education other roommate how to deal with feelings, the most classic one is the boyfriend: To fully believe, is to believe in yourself. A girl so smart, how will the "reduced" to the point of check boyfriend phone today? Counterproductive. This absurd agreement, from the entry into force of the first day, began a step by step "stifle our feelings.</p>
<p>Her because she did not know the <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/michael-vick-jersey-c-14.html">Michael Vick Youth Jersey</a> phone I asked over and over again, will force me to explain because some joke SMS. Slowly, I'm tired, and no longer respond to the questions she was bored. She was also tired and too lazy and I quarrel, questioning those who did not answer the answer. We feel unhappy together than separately calm down.</p>
<p>Mention these now, I still think of when we stick together when happy, but followed her with suspicion and after an argument, we tired expression. I still love her, so do not want to lose her, I believe she was that simple, warm and a little girl, all because she loved me, I want her to come back, anew back trust each other miss life, but she refused.</p>
<p>I believe what he says is true, but I also understand her difficulties, she refused to be due to the absence of love. She gave me the phone, she said: "I can not face him, will no longer be able to face their own and I do not know why they would be foolish enough to go to be suspicious of people who love me so, I hate myself for ever those stupid practices. those groundless suspicions caused him to want to escape me, depriving me feel tired and I do not want him to stay forever in the memories of those 'hysterical' quarrel, so I can only choose to leave. "</p>
<p>I always thought that as long as there is love, there is nothing wrong. Looked at him in front of a loss, <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/patrick-willis-jersey-c-15.html">Patrick Willis Youth Jersey</a> thinking about the love he still chose to leave her, I thought, Maybe love and people need space, you need oxygen in order to get the most basic survival</p>
