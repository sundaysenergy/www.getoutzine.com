<p>Girl holding a lunch box blankly standing behind the boy's, saw him happily typing on the keyboard, and he's Audition wife tells endless love, the hearts of girls pulling a bit, but she still told myself, this is just a network only . Her lunch box on the boy the <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/clay-matthews-jersey-c-9.html">Clay Matthews Youth Jersey</a> deskside said: "Hurry up and eat cold not tasty." Boys head to TU did not lift a cry, to continue his love, then large dedication. The girl walked in silence.</p>
<p>There is a love called patience at the moment is 2:00, the girl sighed, she does not expect the boy will take her, but one told if. Her tolerant smile, home.</p>
<p>A few months later ...</p>
<p>The girl said: "look me in the eye and say you betrayed our love, say ah you!"</p>
<p>The boy said: "No, I did not, I just said she wanted to see me, and nothing more, I said you would not, but she still chose to and she also knows that I have a girlfriend, tomorrow afternoon she would come to this cafe , she said, just take a look at me! "</p>
<p>The girl said: "Just take a look at it? You love to network coverage to five years of emotionally right? Can I talk to her?"</p>
<p>The boy said: "I did not, I did not ... she also said to want to <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/eli-manning-jersey-c-10.html">Eli Manning Youth Jersey</a> meet you! I said, do not pick her up, because you're in, her own!"</p>
<p>3 o'clock in the afternoon the next day, the boy's Audition wife appeared on time in Internet cafes, the boy called her snow, the snow is very beautiful, very energetic, only 18 years old this year, a full 5-year-old than girls. The snow line of sight through the boy falls girl haggard face, smiling at each other, there is no hostility. Girl schematic boy evaded, the boy got the message to get back on the front of the computer to continue his dances, girl holding snow sitting in the next chair. Silence after a long while, the snow boldly spoke up: "I love him, love not limited to the network."</p>
<p>Girl: "Love is not a passion, not impulsive, you know him?" Or say that you understand your own? "</p>
<p>Why not leave on good snow: "You have no love, is not it??"</p>
<p>Girl: "Oh, I give you the first ten things you listen!"</p>
<p>Snow: "You say I listen first."</p>
<p>Girl aligned with the line of sight to the boy, <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/joe-flacco-jersey-c-11.html">Joe Flacco Youth Jersey</a> the boy immediately taken back erect ears. The girl smiled, back to the line of sight:</p>
<p>"First, he is a special love to sleep late every morning and at least 20 times to call his name, he will obediently get up out after he never buy their own breakfast, so every day you had done for him the breakfast he finished was assured he is so casual, will not take care of themselves.</p>
<p>He reveled in Wonderland can not extricate themselves, when playing at home every night, yelling, and never looked down on the others sleep, and the next day you always have to face the taunts of neighbors, not stop to apologize.</p>
<p>Third, many of his friends, each dinner with the primary task of drinking, his body is not very good, <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/matt-ryan-jersey-c-12.html">Matt Ryan Youth Jersey</a> Baijiu 7 two, drink beer, 4 bottles, can not do more than he would be drunk others will be drunk tea him a cup of tea on the spit to the dozen, very Shang Wei.</p>
<p>Fourth, he is a football fan, the World Cup every four years, the biennial Champions League or European Cup, each week Serie A, what the football world, the English Premier League, he will not miss the middle of the night get up and watch the game. When he read, you have to get up and clean up the garbage in it next to the TV, as well as the kitchen was turned upside meals.</p>
<p>Fifth, the annual fall of one, his eyes were winds will stop blink, tears. Do you know what medicine he had to eat it? In each of the five years, gave him to drink medicine can but he never knew that drug is medicine, what name.</p>
<p>Sixth, his hand to the winter will be split, not frostbite, is his lack of a vitamin in the body, not the illness can not get to the root of the problem, to be painted in the hand creams and pills eat you know what you? He does not know, because he does not own medicine, every time to get his hands, he was eating!</p>
<p>The seventh, he is dead too proud people, friends, inevitably, some people like to take who or who's girlfriend joke, no matter how wronged, and more too much, can show it when his friend's face, a friend for him the most important.</p>
<p>Eighth, sometimes he does not always go home, or dance the night away in the cafe, PK is <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/matt-schaub-jersey-c-13.html">Matt Schaub Youth Jersey</a> his hobby. Sometimes in small groups and the reality of a friend chat until dawn, or middle of the night knock on the door, and told you he obediently home. "</p>
<p>Ninth, I believe he is absolutely not a macho man, even if his friend, carrying his girlfriend out bulbs other girls, he would not do so, because he cares about is the feeling of two people together, rather than to meet the desires of their own so-called man.</p>
<p>Tenth, on the whole, he regarded as a good man, is too sloppy, do not know to take care of themselves, like a big boy. Oh, he opened the cupboard to get the clothes will definitely forget to turn off the cupboard, opened the drawer to get the fire machine will absolutely forgot to turn off the drawer, you're not behind him, afraid of him out will forget to close.</p>
<p>You have to understand it? You can do it? Love a person in the end how do you think? Snow said: "little love will leave marks on anybody, you have Shuididanchuan to every word I have nowhere to go." '</p>
<p>Boy then pulled out and dance in the girl's every word knock on his heart, feelings, and she very much aware of him, his weaknesses, his strengths, his preferences, his everything she see in the eyes, the love in my heart. 5 years, why he never found myself so confused if it had not have been the girl at his side, his life will be worse into what. Looked at himself clothes, shoes, socks, and he do not even know why always so neat and clean, why he never took the spatula, was able to eat delicious meals every day, why their not uncomfortable here is there pain, but over the past five years, he always eats the girl to arrange the food he ate, but feel so healthy, why his friends always envy him, why does he love the feel and girls become so short, why his crush on the network will release the feelings, too bland, they almost never had any quarrel, because the girls always give way to accommodate silent trivial life loved him! He suddenly understand why someone would say that true love is not a mountain ridge, Heaven, and the king is never dare with, but the profound feelings of understanding and tolerance. The boy turned his head and staring at the girl, for many years, and he has not carefully read the girl's face more than five <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/michael-vick-jersey-c-14.html">Michael Vick Youth Jersey</a> seconds, the first time he found the lively, beautiful girl has now grown into a mature, elegant woman.</p>
<p>The boy stood up and walked in front of the girl said: "you how old? Oh, I just found out ... Oh! Wife, we have a good time together to accompany the snow, she rarely comes once." Snow knowingly smiled and said: "do not I left, you are a good man, The more good wife, I believe that someday I would like her to love a man, the only man that I love will not you, because you are not my Then the snow turned to leave, her tears like Road beautiful rainbow, she turned it depicts a graceful arc!</p>
<p>The girls always maintained a polite smile, perhaps her heart had been severely cuts, but her calm, wise to restore the feelings of this painstakingly built five years. Boy gently holding the girl, the smell of her hair fragrant, 5 years, the scent on the girls hair has not changed, as she has been in love with his heart not changed, her hair is so delicate silky feelings as she operated a harmonious and gentle. The boy smiled and asked the girl:</p>
<p>"Wife medicine, you gave me to eat in the end is what medicine ah? Until now, I really do not know yet." Do not want to tell you, because I only know, you leave me, maybe will not live Oh, Oh. "</p>
<p>"Yeah, I feel good horror, oh, I'm not under house arrest for a lifetime, ah?" How you know? Who told you so restless ah? Guanyin Bodhisattva will give the monk a rule that monkey recipe So God see my poor, help me help you. "</p>
<p>"Wife, you is not never watching football this? Why you would be held every four years, two years, or even football matches each week so clear about ah?"</p>
<p>"Hey ah, who told the account password you connected Wonderland that is called Batistuta's!" Ah ... you know? Do not steal my equipment Oh for me property to be your property, I decided to ... "</p>
<p>Decide what ah? "</p>
<p>"Tomorrow is Sunday, do not know the Civil Affairs Bureau will be no one to <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/patrick-willis-jersey-c-15.html">Patrick Willis Youth Jersey</a> work ah, I decided to go tomorrow and you get a love certificate for insurance equipment, our property become common, as you will take care of the, ! "</p>
<p>"Marry you have to change a pattern out? I also do not want to marry you."</p>
<p>The boy suddenly picked up the girl, fiercely and kissed her mouth, the girl rushed pushed little face flushed, looked embarrassed at the sight of people around, and regarded them as a focal point. The boy loudly geological asked the girl: "marry, do not marry me? Did not marry me here today performing long kiss." Then the boy took the girl hugged the girl smiled and said humorously: "Jiala, Jiala! I waited five years</p>
