<p>Love is a difficult thing, it will consume your youth. Hopeless waiting time river refused to stop and rushes, I willingly boarded the shore of the others. Disregard the changing circumstances, can only make love to stay in the first years.</p>
<p>Raymond with all of the savings in the river to buy a house, the small size, smaller than the heart of the sparrow, but opened the window you can smell the breath of the river, which is hard to come by. More unusual is that the name is on the real estate license I Ge small cloth.</p>
<p>Bigger way to a master's identity fitting it, the walls of the living room is a green fruit, with a little red double sofa, want dazzling of a number of dazzling; bedroom is shallow purple, such as the dreamy color, engulfed I assertive dream.</p>
<p>I squatted on the ground to wipe the paint was dry, Raymond suddenly Xipixiaolian near me: "report homeowners, this is my last property, application turned over but this stuff is a bit shabby, $ 80, or after the discount price."</p>
<p>His last sentence sounds emboldened clearly insufficient. I <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/pittsburgh-steelers-antonio-brown-jersey-c-532_553.html">Antonio Brown Jersey</a> grinned, his hand is a thin silver ring, shiny diamond, platinum heavy, but that slight sheen, Cecil strands to hitch my heart.</p>
<p>"Wear it! I to marry him!" He pleaded pester.</p>
<p>"How can there be such a suitor?" Some of my nose acid, bowed his head, so as not to see the tears moved me that kid will not get carried away. "Come on, I'll give you to wear." He rubs up against me before. I held out my fingers, looking stern: "every day to give you wiping the floor, the fingers are thicker." Turned to the kitchen sink, the face laugh possession are difficult to hide.</p>
<p>Phone was babbling at this time rang, and the voice on the phone, I'll never forget: "Ge small cloth, I come back!"</p>
<p>Smile moment froze in the face.</p>
<p>The season winter morning wearing a pair of rimless glasses, Sven many. But I'm still a recognized him, and he sat in the coffee room of the hotel, slightly upturned chin, looking at the floor-to-ceiling windows. I was standing the San Weikui back, hesitated, and finally on <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/pittsburgh-steelers-brett-keisel-jersey-c-532_562.html">Brett Keisel Jersey</a> the left ring finger the rocket thin ring gently spin down and put it in my backpack.</p>
<p>I appear in the season before the winter morning. The smile on his face slowly open, like missed the season's flowers. The season winter morning drinking coffee posture like a highly qualified returnees.</p>
<p>I curl one's lip: "quarter winter morning, your past is not so." My 19-year-old understanding of the quarter winter morning, he was giving her a crew cut, smoke Camel, raising his hand to put the bully to beat my little rogue nose bleeding. That is a hero to save the American encounter, his volume is more like a bear and I is not beauty. From that day on, I became a stooge, people say quarter winter morning is a little rascal, I can still feel him, because his eyes are clear.</p>
<p>"Last night just under the aircraft."</p>
<p>"For so many years and to contact me."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid one could not help but hear your voice the other end to fly back from the Pacific."</p>
<p>"You will open this ambiguous joke? Your not simply," I laughed.</p>
<p>"Really, Ge small cloth, I miss you."</p>
<p>This he said, not actually laugh, looked at me gravely, his eyes still as clear, clear like <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/pittsburgh-steelers-heath-miller-jersey-c-532_552.html">Heath Miller Jersey</a> lakes on the plateau in the autumn. His handbag and pulled out a leather cigarette case, pull out a cigarette, lit and slowly exhales, pale blue smoke ring blocking my eye.</p>
<p>That old cigarette case has been frayed corners, that was my poor pin fine sewing. That year, I gave him the cigarette case, he casually throw in the basket in the car, he said, this thing with me a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>I turned around and looked out the window, heart fluttered, alas, if not many years ago he hit the emotional jab, I am afraid that this time also fall into the lakes of his eyes.</p>
<p>Coffee cold. He stood up, I walk in his shadow, than they were many years ago that small a stooge. We do not speak.</p>
<p>Quarter winter morning car stop in the riverside apartment. The lift he looked up: "My life was a good thing! Invited me to sit up?" I smiled, shook his head.</p>
<p>In fact, he did not get off, I would not have invited him. Because the 19th floor of a small room, a man named Raymond's men are not familiar with the name of a quarter winter morning.</p>
<p>I and Raymond understanding at a friends party, a large-scale gathering of hundred come, do not know who is who, he suddenly pushed in front of me, and said aloud: "I crush on you for two months." He quoted his own screen name, my eyes wide open, but it was his throw me every day in my version on tile.</p>
<p>Raymond is a science Male, humorous, some shameless, at least in the process of pursuing my, he is willing to tear their own nerve. He no similar place and the season winter morning, the most important thing is that he loves me.</p>
<p>I met 25-year-old Raymond that year, the season of winter morning to three years in Germany, no news, I think I need for a cautious, such as porcelain to love me.</p>
<p>When I opened the door, Raymond has new house mess cleaned up, he was Pazaichuangkou, never looking back: "That car quite stick, driving a little fat kid."</p>
<p>"Old school" I have some guilty conscience to explain that, in fact, just drink coffee for half an hour and a quarter winter morning.</p>
<p>"I did not jealous," he grinned. His eyes sweeping across in my hands, I <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/pittsburgh-steelers-james-harrison-jersey-c-532_557.html">James Harrison Jersey</a> suddenly found myself to forget the the rocket thin ring wear. Raymond smiled and ran into the kitchen, I looked at the river daze, the thin pain in my heart.</p>
<p>Once again see the season winter morning in high school on the anniversary. He sat in the middle of the crowd, old faces tough teachers eager to praise his today's academic success, business start-ups.</p>
<p>I'm in the crowd was silent. Around these grown up sophisticated for faces I could not bear to a review. Quarter winter morning still put me on the side, like youth, where he was walking in me where. We no longer a 19-year-old Love.</p>
<p>20 years old, I was admitted to the good reputation of the university. He was forcing his father into the college entrance cram. I gave him a week to write a letter within six months, he returned only one, he said he is still a daily fight, skipping classes, doing nothing.</p>
<p>His birthday, I'm all the way back home, I gave him a leather cigarette case, he whistled thrown into the cart basket. I said quarter winter morning, I actually liked you, I hope you can test to A City. He looked at me, exaggerated laugh. He said when I buddy child.</p>
<p>I did not give him a letter, and a year later, he suddenly quietly went to Germany, he never knew, inseparable with his youthful years, my heart has been so painful beyond Love in pain.</p>
<p>The season winter morning from the crowd turned to paste in my ear, said: "We're skipping it!" When I did not respond, he took my hand away from the crowd. The my palm oozing fine sweat.</p>
<p>He took me to the best western restaurant in the city, the Raymond Western restaurant is <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/pittsburgh-steelers-lamarr-woodley-jersey-c-532_546.html">Lamarr Woodley Jersey</a> beyond me. Faced with that English menu, I was embarrassed. He told the foreign waiters oral fluency, graceful. I stayed for a moment, even felt the immediate quarter winter morning and then froze head the kid Geshan impermeable far.</p>
<p>Jewelry box in front of me, a beautiful diamond ring light flashing in the candlelight.</p>
<p>"I do not know is not late, but still want to give you, in fact, been in like you, only then you are too good, I feel good enough for you. Later decided to go abroad, decided to take struggle, we must the best love I give you the first day is very difficult, and only think of that you can get through it. "when he said these words, still very calm, like the idol actor.</p>
<p>"Season winter morning, you must be in the primary school is no good to listen to teacher lectures, otherwise you will not disregard the changing circumstances of the story do not know." Deflated deflated mouth, tears streaming down. Yes, ah, it was too late, my outstretched left hand, exposing my slender silver ring. Quarter winter morning, me you do not love people, not a single one.</p>
<p>The other girls do not know how long to unrequited love when young, but love is a difficult thing, it will consume your youth. Hopeless waiting time river refused to stop and rushes, I willingly boarded the shore of the others.</p>
<p>I quarter winter morning farewell. I did not tell him, the love of his remains in the <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/pittsburgh-steelers-mike-wallace-jersey-c-532_535.html">Mike Wallace Jersey</a> appropriateness of heart, but has nothing to do, and now he. It can only remain in the initial years.</p>
<p>Back to the riverside apartment, Raymond has a good night's sleep in the quilt.</p>
<p>I hugged him from behind, he suddenly turned around, like a child head against my chin: "I'm afraid you do not come back."</p>
<p>I am shocked that this fearless disgrace also not afraid of Raymond turned so worried about me?</p>
<p>"I'm so poor, the lifetime may be so poor, you will not regret it?"</p>
<p>I kick with his left foot to his right foot. With the <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/detroit-lions-calvin-johnson-jersey-c-197_208.html">Calvin Johnson Jersey</a> hardship of happiness is better than cowardice cowardly escape. Reason to fall in love with the arms of this man, because he has a brave heart, he knows, the ring 80 can also represent the most faithful lifetime commitment.</p>
<p>Riverside middle of the night, someone singing, please allow me to dust settles, singing gossamer-fine, followed the river run. Love should run forward.</p>
