<p>Person's life is a mutual interest, caring, everyone has emotional needs, which, verbal communication and emotional expression is critical. Do not let love just know that you care with conjecture, but to each other from time to time to feel <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/aj-green-jersey-c-1.html">A.J. Green Youth Jersey</a> your mind, this is to open our mouths to tell each other you love also a need for action to express the degree of love.</p>
<p>Love need to express love is to open your heart and let it free flowing, so that the other can see, hear, feel,.</p>
<p>No matter how busy, do not forget to make a phone call to the wife; matter how tired, to be home to love a hug; regardless of how many troubles in life should be to love a smile ... love hearts, we should speak up say it, you should do it, <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/aaron-rodgers-jersey-c-2.html">Aaron Rodgers Youth Jersey</a> and share the warmth and happiness of the hearts of the actions and language of the subject.</p>
<p>Love does not show there is no love is expressed.</p>
<p>Love is not only the actual life the poor Youyanjiangcu tea, it is a solemn thing, it needs to deal with and commitment, you need to confirm and encourage. Expression of love can be singing in the night garden can be drawing near the vows, because these are means commitment and responsibility means accepting and desire. Ancient times, whether East or West, expressions of love are varied, it passed with songs of love, love, praise in verse, written love sentiment of love with the brush, the physical expression of love and sustenance love keepsake ......</p>
<p>Love the most direct and effective way is to say it with words, do not underestimate this one is simple, it will be all love all passed thorough the other heart.</p>
<p>After the expression of love was <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/andre-johnson-jersey-c-3.html">Andre Johnson Youth Jersey</a> only given a life with a profound sense of soul.</p>
<p>Expression of love is not necessarily expensive, not necessarily time-consuming, to live with for a long time, some trivial expression of love may become habits. For example, for the love brew a cup of hot tea, to love tucking play a joke with the lover. Of course, the tea may be too hot, the angle may not need to tuck the joke may be slightly vulgar. However, do not refuse. Because you refuse, is not an action, but love. We want to know, care of the hot soup never light than Rose the expression of love component.</p>
<p>Life like water placid, flat light, slowly flowing through the man's forehead and the woman of his eyes. We knew it, the years of the lines on the climb once young face. Orderly time, the love easily become staid, loss of rhythm and color. A timely manner not only to express love in exchange for the fading warmth, flavoring agent and it is life, so every day immersed in hope and joy.</p>
<p>Laugh, read newspapers and magazines, cut out the article gave him his favorite wife said an old joke, I remember that day saying good morning, good night, <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/cam-newton-jersey-c-8.html">Cam Newton Youth Jersey</a> good-bye, shared with him he was interested in the ball game, or other activities together in the kitchen and make a meal solemnly for a trifle thank him, to buy him some quaint little gift, remember the birthday of his parents ... these are life, crushing things, but lets love to feel your love from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>Expression of love to his heart was to see the other side, look at the the sinking heart's love, warmth and caring, and tremble. Of mundane people, hearts to each other to do the best in simple, subtle, long way, and this is more consistent and our simple, subtle, long life.</p>
<p>"I love you" is the world's most beautiful language. Lovers, an "I love you", is often the beginning of the emotional temperature. Between a husband and wife, "I love you" often love fresh recipe. Love to say, let each other know what you love; love have to do to prove the depth of your love.<br />
He never loved her. Never. But still married to her, because it was going to stay in the big cities, not to return to the rustic town, and her father is a big city government <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/andrew-luck-jersey-c-4.html">Andrew Luck Youth Jersey</a> officials, for their own purposes, he married her not beautiful nor good .</p>
<p>She loved him more than anything else has. Not because his looks Pan, also due to the erudite superior because of his proud look, even his thick black hair and his frown like, and also realize that their own do not deserve him, so all hold on him, even as he and his old lover lingering. What he did is sad, but she was always reluctant to say break.</p>
<p>He was always cold, a  indifference, not like the man in the honeymoon, and she always tried to call sent his love with passion, the result, of course, always without success, as if the more efforts, the more vain.</p>
<p>The honeymoon is nothing to fear, even in front of him and another woman were flirting, but not a woman. Her cry and cry behind his back, in the face of his still smiling, but he turned a blind eye, still as an outsider.</p>
<p>Just like a year, she filed for divorce. This marriage as shaped corpse walking meat, is nothing <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/calvin-johnson-jersey-c-7.html">Calvin Johnson Youth Jersey</a> more than a waste of youth, is also not fair to him, even though she loved him so hard to break away. Love, it is so bitter, so, it is better to not love it.</p>
<p>He refused to allow it. He knew lost her he would lose all, she or his props, previously has no curtain call, do not make her exit.</p>
<p>She had also promised his own day than the day of lean. Students are the envy of her find a good husband, there was also decent, also arranged in vital sectors of the government, will definitely amazing. Only she knows. Own suffering, can not be said, and said he would have done, and she is so love him, love him, it means that all bear his, including forgiveness and to forgive his betrayal and infidelity.</p>
<p>She finally sick face one day seemingly difficult day, parents actually thought she was pregnant, went to check, actually advanced liver cancer. She is very calm, and smiled and said gently, a poet once said, splendid Shengruxiahua, dead as autumn leaves, I really do, nothing is not right.</p>
<p>She finally die, before Pro go, he bent over her chest and asked her what wish? Her eyes closed, and said softly, if there is an afterlife, I would like a beautiful flower, even if you only love one day. She closed my eyes, and then did not wake up, <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/antonio-brown-jersey-c-5.html">Antonio Brown Youth Jersey</a> and the corner of the eye, but slipped Qinglei to a drop.</p>
<p>He burst into tears. That moment, he found out that he is the sort of negative this silly woman.</p>
<p>Organize her belongings when he saw her diary. It turned out that every time he and the woman mercy that she was perfectly clear, slightly above tears. One day, she wrote: I was destined to be a heart-breaking fish, and he is my only water, but <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/ben-roethlisberger-jersey-c-6.html">Ben Roethlisberger Youth Jersey</a> refused to give, so, I am only one person slowly ashore wait withered. Because she had known death is nearly. Love is dead, the fish live longer without fun. He found out, the original appearance of how ordinary girl this Rouchang knot, can also have the heartache of love, while he totally ignores such a loving heart, and even let her ashore, dead.</p>
