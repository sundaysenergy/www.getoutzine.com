<p>I Tao married for almost three years, I have never doubted his love for me. I'm pretty, temperament, qualifications and his considerable salary is not less than he took. Marry like my wife, was his previous life a blessing to repair.</p>
<p>Goodness rival, let me find  <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/roddy-white-jersey-c-23.html">Roddy White Youth Jersey</a> love day office a few married women are discussing how to look at the prison her husband. When they ask for my thoughts, I said, I can be bothered to do those that really have an affair if I derailed the probability is 100 times higher than my husband!</p>
<p>I did not expect marriage so confident, but still defeated in a silent "emotional battle" ...</p>
<p>I want to meet that woman let Tao heart</p>
<p>In office discussion a few weeks <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/russell-wilson-jersey-c-24.html">Russell Wilson Youth Jersey</a> after the end of the Tao, go to a business trip. Evening to complete the day's work, I idly loitering on the network. May be curious, and perhaps would like to confirm the faithful of the Tao, I suddenly wanted to explore what happens to open his e-mail. I said to myself: I can only guess the password three times, if not get in even. Unexpectedly, the trial before the second mailbox actually opened - Tao set the password is my birthday. It seems that he is still my heart. I secretly proud.</p>
<p>However, two e-mail in the mailbox made me shocked. That is the signature for piano woman. The letter is very short, but the word is ambiguous: Tao, do not stay up late. Tao, want you ... I suddenly realized this simplicity of love, then, much as many days and I did not whisper in the ear of her husband before!</p>
<p>A I'm lying in bed crying, because I <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/tim-tebow-jersey-c-25.html">Tim Tebow Youth Jersey</a> never expected this situation! How can I do? Finally, I went to that mailbox sent an e-mail, leaving only one sentence: I am the wife of Tao, if possible, talk to us about. I want to meet that allows Tao heart of a woman, she is not the United States if the angel or charming?</p>
<p>She said: I just like to do a pure woman</p>
<p>Piano about and I meet in a cafe. I was some apprehension, regret not find a few more sisters to help out.</p>
<p>Piano time. I carefully looked at the stranger rival: a white dress, not tall, looks not really pretty very handsome, hung faint smile on his face, a look that is a good-natured woman.</p>
<p>"About you and my husband ... I want to hear the truth." I said, straight to the point.</p>
<p>Qin kept his head <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/tom-brady-jersey-c-26.html">Tom Brady Youth Jersey</a> down, for a long time, she said "sorry" Next, I embark on the process of their interaction.</p>
<p>The original, the piano is Tao colleagues in the department a celebration dinner, they are just sitting next to him, a bad cough that day Tao, piano happens to know a medicines for cough, recommended to him. After dinner, they represent exactly the same way, so they talk on - piano husband passed away two years ago, she had no children, lives alone. Conversation, Tao learned piano home's water heater is broken, take the opportunity, enthusiastically proposed to help her repair.</p>
<p>The Tao the awesome, Sanxialiangxia to put bad days water heater to be repaired! "Qin excitement appreciation, like in appreciation for their husbands. In fact, the Tao is usually very competent home something bad, he can fix. I always feel that he should do, never remembered praised him for this - I forget the men sometimes like children, and is obsessed with praise.</p>
<p>Qin also said that day Tao see the plants <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/tony-gonzalez-jersey-c-27.html">Tony Gonzalez Youth Jersey</a> and flowers Amberpack her eyes are bright. In fact, Tao also like to plant flowers and grass, but always I say as a proper job. Since then, their increasingly frequent exchanges.</p>
<p>"I'm not you beautiful, did not you capable, I just like to be a pure woman." After listening to the piano, I actually did not get angry, like listening to someone else's story for a long time before the pressure of cross God, I think of the story The actor is my husband.</p>
<p>After farewell and piano, it was already dark. I did not go home, but a man sitting in the garden in our community for a while. I think a lot, and begin to understand why someone like piano so an ordinary woman could even win the Tao, and even my favor - she is not like me, always Tao repeated demands a lot of requirements, the contrary, regardless of who she was all sweetness and light , considerate, she and Tao still has the same hobbies, the requirements of family life, as delicate and serene.</p>
<p>Such a rival, how I might not be lost to her?</p>
<p>I was speechless jealousy, but not hatred</p>
<p>A week later, Tao back from a <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/tony-romo-jersey-c-28.html">Tony Romo Youth Jersey</a> business trip. I did not tell him I saw the piano, just a long silence in front of him. I do not know what to say. Tao found my strange, that I worry about things work will be considerate to comfort me: work always have things go wrong, take it will be good, not too tired himself. "I do not know why, this time, listen to him then speak softly, my heart burst of pain.</p>
<p>A few days later, I phoned the piano, want to go to her house to see. The piano readily agreed. We are like a pair of friends known for many years, despite the fact that we only met once, but also rather embarrassing identity.</p>
<p>Little piano home, more than 40 square meters, decorated clean, vibrant, spider plants, ivy, green radish, patchwork. I do not know what to describe my surprise.</p>
<p>, Are you raising? "The piano smiled and nodded his head, the end gave me a cup of her own bubble Babao tea: a few slices of dried rose petals, a few grains of bright wolfberry, matched with an Sterculia. I can not help but admire from her attentive.</p>
<p>The bedroom is full of warm piano: wide bed, sky blue bedspread embroidered with flowers of the same color, the five color bar Xiantan free to ride in the bed.</p>
<p>"Bedspread is beautiful!" I said sincerely. "Thank you! I do," Qin answer surprised me. Basically, these needlework is an idiot, even the nail does not presentable buttons! I imagine Tao sitting on the floor of the piano home, looked at the piano as Chlorophytum watering, sipping bubble tea she personally ... so warm the scenes, which men do not be tempted?</p>
<p>I recall once Tao travel a half months, I forgot basin Chlorophytum his favorite watering, when he came back, spider plants have withered. The Tao very distressed, but I do not care to say: "No pots the Chlorophytum thing? Lose it!" Tao reason I <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/torrey-smith-jersey-c-29.html">Torrey Smith Youth Jersey</a> did not. Then we made no species Chlorophytum. Maybe, I love and Tao wither in the contradictions of this time and time again speechless. I was speechless jealousy, but not hatred.</p>
<p>Leave the Tao of these days, I finally found myself love him so much</p>
<p>After going back, I left a letter to the Tao. I have not questioned his affair, just to say I lost to a woman, completely lost, admit defeat.</p>
<p>"Tao, I want to calm some time, I agree to a divorce, If you wish so you can then, if you really love her, I should let go ..."</p>
<p>I bought a train ticket to Hangzhou, close the phone. Tao has repeatedly wanted to take me to Hangzhou to see, I always push too busy with work to go not. Today, Hangzhou heaven, do not know it is appropriate healing?</p>
<p>However, the body in Hangzhou, but always worried about two hundred kilometers outside the home. Tao Qin, doing what? They will not be happy?</p>
<p>Leave the Tao of these days, I finally realize that they love him so much. I regret no good operating our marriage. These insights, however, was too late.</p>
<p>People always cherish only lost, but fortunately I still have time to restore</p>
<p>A few days later, I opened the phone, the God Guichai dial piano telephone. I really want to know, I automatically quit, will not let her joyfully. Telephone communication, piano heard was my edgy begged me not to hang up, "Tao find you find it very hard, sent did not go to the police he is always in the <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/troy-polamalu-jersey-c-30.html">Troy Polamalu Youth Jersey</a> self-blame, say sorry to you, the harder life burst into tears At that moment, I understand that he loves you ...... "</p>
<p>The piano's voice choked, and telephone head, I also broke down in tears.</p>
<p>That night, I went back home. Tao know I want to come back, specifically a large table of my favorite dishes. This a narrowly love crisis, so I finally see themselves and their marriage. Always cherish only lost, but fortunately I still have time to restore.</p>
<p>A storm in the past dusk, I received the phone from the piano, said she must leave the next day to go to Xiamen, where there is more work for her. I suddenly some saw it, because these days, I have already looked upon her as the enemy.</p>
<p>In many cases, marital problems are not the responsibility of just one person. I know not to become a piano, then lightly whisper virtuous naive, but at least I learned from her how to allow yourself to become more likable - the face of the Tao, I know how to hang in the face friendly smile.</p>
<p>I bought a pot of Chlorophytum gave Tao, no matter how busy, I will always remember watering it every day. A successful wife, not only if tis former barbed proud of roses, more if the person is growing on the lush green spider plants, against his lover, gentle, smiling ...</p>
<p>The Chlorophytum often hanging in the air, known as the "sky fairy. The Chlorophytum The slender leaves, Cuise such as washing, hanging out by the basin along a different lengths stolons, each stem end Aung students with new strains of large and small, graceful floating in the air like butterflies eat only a little, and if fireworks lovers, and memorable.</p>
<p>Seasons bright green have powerful suction sewage skills, inexpensive and the conservation also very convenient - Chlorophytum has been the most favorite bedroom hanging plants recruit people. The woman has Chlorophytum temperament, gentle and approachable, they never speak aloud, and who is not reflected <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/victor-cruz-jersey-c-31.html">Victor Cruz Youth Jersey</a> in its traumatic rattling. Looks weak in fact, is their most powerful weapon, the feminine that inadvertently comes out, is the most attractive.<br />
To much money do? ! And then a big house, suitable for sleep, but just a love half of the bed. Sheltered, still like to wear linen shirt cloth jacket, delicious was actually porridge salted egg.</p>
<p>This life, you need so much money doing? !</p>
<p>Maybe people say that this is a money-driven society, the desire of people to seek money as well as have the vanity of money so that it will never move forward. Another person said, the purpose of man to conquer the world in order to finally get a woman; woman by a man to give the world.</p>
<p>This is what a Miao card! Conquer the world lost a woman is their favorite; be the world lost a man of their own favorite. Success, or look successful, but also thoroughly defeated. This is full of bitter, painful results, did you want to do?</p>
<p>I like people to calmly face life given, should not be because of the actions of others, to lose yourself thinking of the future. The desire is no end to the black hole, but we do not let it ripped our hearts, because once our hearts with the gap, then the cold air will brazenly where traveling back and forth through our lifetime lost warm, lonely and cold.</p>
<p>Believe in love. Sometimes we really do not see any reason can rely on each other, it seems that the world is doomed every day making fun of Mind rich purse shy person. Generally such, to be honest, it should be respected. I do not think, because they want to see the so-called poverty, seen in the eyes of others, and to give up the original commitment together to change and wear, finally even began to doubt the purpose of life, is really the case, is the biggest sorrow.</p>
<p>Many small cities, small where warmth, calm people love living in the world, does not require a lot of money, but they have endless love.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in this society we have today, you calmly peace with around great luck, those unlimited publicity proud, it may be very difficult, when you probably intended it hard. In fact, with a life full of money, plain poor, there is no real sense of loss and disparity, all that exists in the light of the people's hearts, it is this light so that we are increasingly wisdom.</p>
