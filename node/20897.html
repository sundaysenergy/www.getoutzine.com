<p>I remember just newly married when, the morning will wake up in his arms, I always blushing dare say early, afraid of the mouth of the tone wrinkled his brow; Tumbler with toothbrush insisted and he put together with different color to see only couple feeling; I will help his RBI work clothing, shirt with tie, he might put on the body only after my aesthetic. Got up on the table for his health, I transform every day a different pattern of breakfast, sunny <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/roddy-white-jersey-c-23.html">Roddy White Youth Jersey</a> days might be bacon and eggs with toast; Some rain, perhaps to a little gruel take pickles salted egg; if cloudy, it is better to eat the outside fried fritters and soy milk ... moves to used I change new tricks, but I never get tired.<br />
Married for five years, reunited love in addition to when a virtuous wife, I also made no secret of his enthusiasm, "I love you" is a daily escort him to go to work, must say, and then attach an intimate kiss, even if he mostly When only shallow smile, is enough I am pleased waited a long time.<br />
However, five years later.<br />
I believe that not to itch, but, in the end is what changed me <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/russell-wilson-jersey-c-24.html">Russell Wilson Youth Jersey</a> and his interaction? Morning can only be confirmed by the folds of the sheets he does exist, even if he occasionally overslept xiaolai bed absolutely hurriedly jumped out of bed, rushed his position often has empty freshen up with clothing.<br />
I've almost forgotten feeling him hug to greet the sunrise. Cups in the toilet after is to break a few years ago, could not find a look like, while the other fell into the toilet, so for a new toothbrush has to change; within five years I do not know for a few pieces, and sometimes we slept confused, but also to spend the same one, what tone do not need to hide.<br />
Are the same color, the same style, he said did not matter. Thus, the confrontation about the Hello Kitty and Doraemon pattern on the sink two Tumbler, Doraemon the cup stuck a green toothbrush, I; Hello Kitty is empty, because he has been changed a while ago with an electric toothbrush, put on the shelf. Cups belong to two different stories in two different locations toothbrush, as if in mockery of our marital <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/tim-tebow-jersey-c-25.html">Tim Tebow Youth Jersey</a> relationship, lopsided. Him out earlier, the RBI his dress is no longer my thing, he will get breakfast? A long time did not eat together, and I also do not have to think hard to think about the menu, check the recipe, anyway, no one to show up. Not to mention the "I love you" this sentence, there is a warm good morning kiss, he no Fu Xiaoshou and said some hypocritical.<br />
Think about it, the past five years, he did not say "I love you", not even once.<br />
Me and him to spend more time, strictly speaking, from seven p.m., that is, after he came back from work. Overtime, that time may be extended to ten o'clock, eleven o'clock.<br />
Newly married when I order him to learn cooking, "to seize the hearts of men, first through his stomach" I am confident that this iron law. So, some restaurant dishes often appear in our food on the table, kung pao chicken, just before dawn intestinal Wang, Scallion Chicken, Pork ... To see him eat happy, and I laugh, although incomplete is my favorite, but his favorite is like.<br />
After dinner, we would snuggle on the couch watching TV, I take him to watch the news, listen to him to comment on national affairs, criticism of social conditions; him to accompany me to see the prime-time, listen I laugh at the story, crying laughing. So I know what the Executive Yuan, Legislative <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/tom-brady-jersey-c-26.html">Tom Brady Youth Jersey</a> Yuan President, he also knows that the popular Li Shimin who played.<br />
I did not expect that five years could change all that.<br />
Cooking classes, I can say that is halfway not know he does not like too much pepper From that day onwards, he began to interfere with my cooking method, kung pao chicken, just before dawn intestinal Wang he began to resist, Scallion chicken told me not to shower oil, even halogen Dongpo put the number of soy sauce, he has something to say. I do the dishes become more and more simple, do not want to go to a cooking class, sometimes a stir-fried vegetables, pork ball soup and preserved eggs, tofu rid of him, but he was no opinion.<br />
I, I can not hold his stomach.<br />
With the increase in the number of his overtime, we rarely watch TV together, I can be said to know nothing about national affairs; He asked without asking, Who is the the Thunderbolt actor is he must not know.<br />
Began between husband and wife made less sense, he said to me, most of them are "Do not wait for me", "go to bed early, I told him, almost back," hot dish in the rice cooker " .<br />
We do not have the same topic, do not have the same interest, in addition to the "couple" nominally Contact our exchanges vague pathetic than ordinary friends might as well.<br />
How ridiculous the relationship between husband and wife, is not it?<br />
Marriage, we have depicted the vision of the future, he said to give birth to two children, the first male, female, brother to protect his sister; I do not think you should enjoy a period of two living children when the <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/tony-gonzalez-jersey-c-27.html">Tony Gonzalez Youth Jersey</a> situation is not quite a hurry, just I do not want to bad mood, and said no.<br />
Married for a while, he is very positive and I created the universe consequential life ", he wants the child can see that he did not wear a condom behavior, but I do not want to, afraid that he was not happy. So I carried him taking the pill.<br />
We still recall the time, he also excitedly took me to the hospital to visit a female friend, she has just given birth to a giant baby finished a four thousand two hundred grams, look wilt Mi lying in bed. I will never forget him across the piece of glass to see the newborn baby, the eyes of the bloom of spirit, but I forget the more a female friend who told me that with the weak tone, her whole day and night pain before seeking doctors changed by natural birth for Caesarean section.<br />
I dare more children.<br />
Today, five years later, he seems to have abandoned the baby thing, after all, he is the only one heat is useless.<br />
However, after work to stay in his empty house, I suddenly felt the birth of a baby is also good, at least the house will be a lively point, my loneliness also less.<br />
He would have started a few years ago with a condom, I do not know what made him change his mind, but it also loose my breath, I'm allergic to contraceptives seems, no matter what brand of change finally come to a edema end.<br />
I guess his myopia of 600 degrees plus flash, should not see my edema and edema after even focus his condom solve a big trouble, he has also brought a new trouble.<br />
I want a baby, but he does not seem to want to, I do not know how to tell his opening.<br />
Not to mention his frequent overtime, often tired and fell down at night to sleep, if I open the mouth, it seems that the relative increase his stress.<br />
Between two people, has enough low ebb, and do not need to add the topic of a cause of conflict.<br />
We love, he liked to take me to freshwater, sitting next to the riverbank to watch the sunset, along the dock were born, you can eat all kinds of snacks of different tastes. The fresh seafood notable, he seems only wise old birds, always know which is the most authentic.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he took me to the ferry to the other side of Bali, where the lively only one way to sell peacock clams, two people can eat a big plate, also felt something more to say.</p>
<p>He will and I'm riding a tandem bicycle ride along the Danshui Old Street to short sea, riding back by short sea, the <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/tony-romo-jersey-c-28.html">Tony Romo Youth Jersey</a> scenery along the way is not very attractive, but the kind of rustic flavor, Chairman of the sea breeze, the salty hit in the face, I am enjoy this atmosphere. Of course, sitting the back seat of a bicycle three days of fishing two days of drying, a good mood when it is stepped on twice, he knows me lazy or hard stepped.<br />
I miss that, really, even after five years, that part of the memories are still vivid in my mind.<br />
Marriage to freshwater number of times, in addition to the wedding that period, almost one of the few, the last two or three years time have not been to.<br />
Every holiday, he is less <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/torrey-smith-jersey-c-29.html">Torrey Smith Youth Jersey</a> than noon does not get up, I see that he was so tired, of course, does not bother him show me around.<br />
The Holiday's fair to say that he and I should be of some common ground, but he was tired, I can only look for a job to do, and friends go to work, go out to shop and talk about right and wrong, but also the way to complain about him.<br />
As for his sleep at home, lunch, dinner, solve their own right!<br />
He did not know the first few months, I have lost its boring myself MRT freshwater.<br />
Sure enough, too long did not go where I did not know the place has become.<br />
Food stalls near the embankment was gone, all concentrated in the MRT station near my place to watch the sunset and he restored into a Long Beach, walking only. The roads clean is certainly good, but the collection I and his memories of the place, and disappeared. Without him to lead the way, and I can not find authentic seafood restaurants, can not find a delicious snack, a person of their own riding not double<br />
People cycling, but I was surprised to find, the freshwater a Fisherman's Wharf, bus past. Fisherman's Wharf, his feet did not set foot, my first step, this is not his only my experience to Fisherman's Wharf side and the scenic beauty of the complex beauty of men, but a kind of artificial Diaoqi contrived. I thought the yacht spent several hundred dollars to take the blue road to the other side of Pali, like a ferry, but lost to the antiquity it around in a big circle and then drove back to the origin.<br />
Bumpy Hull shake me dizzy, I can not remember what beautiful scenery, and even peacock clams did not groan a. <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/troy-polamalu-jersey-c-30.html">Troy Polamalu Youth Jersey</a> Freshwater, and his memories, but also changed. The hearty breakfast one morning, I specifically than him to get up early, cook Dayton after nearly has long been to him.<br />
Then, there is no third party, no quarrel I handed out a divorce settlement. It was the first time I saw him so shocked expression, if that day is April Fool's Day, I think I succeeded.<br />
However, I will not open is so bad joke, he knew I was serious.<br />
Like most men, he did not fly into a rage and began to reprove the woman's guilt; nor crying, knelt down and begged me to leave, he just tried to calm your mood, tacit agreement not say anything to take over, open the door, go to work, as usual .<br />
Perhaps he is also aware that our marital relationship to a bottleneck, and also intends to carefully consider the possibility of divorce, he alienated in recent years, I did not shed a tear, but his indifference, almost exhausting my five years of tears.<br />
I have some regret, regret gradually spread to the heart as a starting point, to pass spread to the top of my head and toes. But regret how about? Do not cut the Gordian knot, just dragging a flat water day, two people shrinkage.<br />
I do not know that their love for him so much more do not know that he love me so much. Marry him, I know his taciturn; marry him, thinking can change his, and has not changed him much.<br />
I love, is not enough to change his and his love are not enough for me to change, and this is probably the key.<br />
Firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar and tea party destroy the sweetness of love, I tasted, but it is with five years in exchange for lessons.<br />
Take advantage of now, no children, no strings attached, I do not covet him anything, this is the best time of divorce?<br />
Dou Zheshou divorce agreement signed my name, after he went out a few hours, I'm still shivering. This is the fear of the unknown, I wait for him to give me a result.<br />
His cold and my five years after my seven days, and cut in pieces. Into his hands from the divorce settlement, for an entire week, he did not and I say a word, sleep sofa, seven days every day as usual commute, in addition to the more lukewarm, I feel his emotions .<br />
That agreement, even if thrown into the trash,<a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/victor-cruz-jersey-c-31.html">Victor Cruz Youth Jersey</a> but also touched the sound of the garbage bag, but he, a sound was heard, I doubt that he did the wrong thing, ignore me for some time, I just want to see will not will forget the divorce thing. I can not stand him in the end how to do? Even the divorce, but also from the so indifferent to it?<br />
However, seven days after he, without more ado, scared I hop.<br />
Early in the morning, I heard the sound he got up in the living room, through the door panels did not real, but I have been waiting for less than he went out to work the door slamming. Burst banging of metal crash to replace the daily routine he has always been quiet, I finally himself up and back, and they opened the door, the smell of the burst of the aroma of food.<br />
"Get up? Eat egg rolls." He smiled, as when I kissed him smile like that after the wedding. I was fiercely jump, the original thought the Furui wave of emotions because of his long absence, thoughtful sky slightest ripple. He was so easily, can eventually lead to my heart.<br />

All day, a few hours of conversation he and I had a long talk, four-fifths of the time, I was crying, because I think he had made a monstrous big mistake.<br />
However, some things do not goes a divorce settlement, I will never know.<br />
