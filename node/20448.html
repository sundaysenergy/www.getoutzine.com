<p>He told her the same session, a fellow of the University of different classes of students, freshmen reported day, thousands of new students waiting in line registration, he wear blue plaid shirt, happens to be ranked in the rear of her, and <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/clay-matthews-jersey-c-9.html">Clay Matthews Youth Jersey</a> from that day he falls for her. . The past four years, he never dared to express his admiration for her, he can only use his silence to express his love for her with companionship, to become her best friend.</p>
<p>She participated in the choir, treble, he is accompanied on the piano, she talked for a few games at school love, he would become a loyal audience, her study abroad after graduation, he was in the army, wrote a sealed letter to United States to encourage her a few years after returning home, she got married, but unfortunately the groom is not he.</p>
<p>She was not complain that he is not <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/eli-manning-jersey-c-10.html">Eli Manning Youth Jersey</a> good enough, nor do not know if he's good for her, only too familiar with each other, she could not imagine the day she told him the situation would be like after the Valentine from a friend into. So she told him between has been swinging back and forth in the gray area of ??friendship and love. She always insisted that she is just good friends with him between, unwilling to face was dependent on him for her good. And he was because of the lack of courage and has always been lukewarm personality so miss each other's fate. Her wedding, he came to power speech to wish her happy. A month later, he quietly lost five kilograms. Since then, she has lost him the news.</p>
<p>Her marriage was not as imagined happiness. Because she was a good strong personality and dedication and strong, and she did not much mind to run her marriage. Plus she used his careful, thoughtful, and accompany her to treat her the way her husband to talk to his good comparison, she began to suspect that the original <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/joe-flacco-jersey-c-11.html">Joe Flacco Youth Jersey</a> husband now how will fancy, she began to feel angry husband as a good friends understand her concern for her to pamper her love her.</p>
<p>A year later, she took the initiative to request a divorce. Single after her more dynamic at work, the workplace more attractive, after years of effort, she finally earned in the advertising industry a piece of the sky, a place. Fame after she began to feel the loneliness, the emptiness of their lives began to miss her good, but her courage to go back to look for him. Because she did not know how they are doing in the past few years. Because she is no longer simply the young before her. Because she had received his wedding invitation sent to her.</p>
<p>A weekend, a month before his marriage, he was about her out to dinner, and she was wondering why he is about to get married, and still offer her out to dinner meeting. That fact, eating <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/matt-ryan-jersey-c-12.html">Matt Ryan Youth Jersey</a> a good meal, he seems back to her student days, she sang soprano playing the piano. Associations of students, teachers of each other, participate in activities ... many past memories flow between each other's memory boosting, many of the vintage anecdotes brought to light in dialogue between the two with her, he felt like going back to that pure and simple student days.</p>
<p>"Next week, I want to get married." He put down his knife and fork, the sudden this sentence.</p>
<p>"Ah, congratulations to you, the other must be very good, will make you willing to marry her."</p>
<p>"One thing I want to tell you," his expression suddenly serious again, "A long time ago, a guy just admitted to the university. Registered his panic and went to school that day, see the registration freshmen are long queues, his heart vexation panic when you are overwhelmed, there is a very friendly girl came up to him and <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/matt-schaub-jersey-c-13.html">Matt Schaub Youth Jersey</a> asked him not to register He found that girls talked to his fellow class classmates, he was so happy, I feel this girl is really good, is a good man and he found that girls have a pair of bright eyes, laugh on cute little eye teeth and dimples, and from that day onwards, he fell in love with her at first sight.</p>
<p>However, he has always been do not know how to express his love for her, she is so pure, so kind, so clever and cleverness, so likable, his personality has always been lukewarm words poorly, had silently accompanied her She made her best friend. So University four years later, he was ready to tell her graduation day: he loved her.</p>
<p>But she was the day before the graduation ceremony text of the shore on the phone to tell him that, she wanted to study abroad. Courage all of a sudden he just sprouted hours without a trace. After graduation, he thought, he was at her to study abroad, he can not bear to pick this time to her confession, she waited two years time, so we waited for her to finish the book return home and then speak.</p>
<p>She went abroad to study his soldiers during the days he is the most hard years. Not only because he is not her, but in the United States, she met a Taiwanese student. He knew that one day is very lonely, and she is afraid of loneliness people, so he as much as possible each week wrote to the United States to greet her, encourage her, for her encouragement, but she replied, in addition to complain great lengths in a Taiwan foreign students to talk about her understanding of how the United States outside of American life all the inconvenience, in the letter, she told him, her love.</p>
<p>In the letter she told him that <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/michael-vick-jersey-c-14.html">Michael Vick Youth Jersey</a> Taiwan students on how well her how much I love her, she wrote to tell him after returning home, she was ready to marry with the students from Taiwan. He was very sad, how things will become like this? Even if he did not declare himself to her, but he has been taking action to care for her, to take care of her and love her, Is she really did not see that his efforts do not really know that he loved her? Or from the outset, all his own wishful thinking, unrequited love? When he received her wedding invitation, he heard his own heart 'bang' bang, broken.</p>
<p>Love is colder than death. He muster the the last courage to attend her wedding, and saw her wedding dress a look of happiness and sweet look, also saw the students from Taiwan, now the groom. He would have wanted to see her go, but was sharp-eyed, she saw his presence Mozhe the he he took office to say a few words of blessing. Others stood on the stage looking at the bride and groom under sitting, I suddenly felt the distance between he and she became very distant, distant to her no longer in the freshman registration, waiting in line in front of him registered girl. Do not remember how embarrassed he is to flee the venue, only know that he later lay in bed for a whole one week, one month lost five kilograms.</p>
<p>He decided to forget her. He apply <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/patrick-willis-jersey-c-15.html">Patrick Willis Youth Jersey</a> for leave without pay to the company, a man hid in Tokyo, Japan, to go to school. That he met a similarly Taiwan to Tokyo to study the girls. The girl in his most frustrated encourage him to stand up, the girl accompany him gentle and careful care of him, inclusive of his past, the girl let him regain confidence, to believe in love again, the girl later became his upcoming married wife. Although he loves his wife, but she was in his heart or a place. So today he will ask her out to meet, to tell her story, the one hand, this he told her in the past to be the end, on the one hand, his heart freed from the memories of the past. Now, he was finally able to let go of her love, wholeheartedly love his newlywed wife. '</p>
<p>After hearing the story, she was silent, without a word, only polite to congratulate him and finally found his happiness. After she told him to drink a toast to each other, she pushed said there was something to be first, he wanted to take her back home, she refused, she wanted him to hurry home to spend more time with his wife. On the way home, she could not help crying fiercely up, totally ignoring the paste off the face of makeup with the taxi driver cast a strange look. All her strong and confident in the moment collapses, she always told myself that he is her best hungry friends, nothing can be said to him. She sometimes feel that her relationship with him like fell in love with a long time lover, has a perfect understanding with each other. In fact, her heart has been waiting for the day he would tell her those three words: "I love you". Her heart has not been able to forgive him Why will not like the other boys, and take the initiative to pursue her. She has been restrained think boys and girls should wait to pursue, and not be able to take the initiative to pursue a favorite of the boys.</p>
<p>Missed all missed. The fate so passed each other, no matter how reluctantly unwilling to accept defeat, was all over. Herself to give up his pursuit, she do not know how to listen to his silence, she did not believe their own heart, she ignored love a person is in fact there are many ways, she asked why he does not say in my heart he loved her, and she in fact has been deeply in love with him. Missed, it is no longer able to look back and can not go back and start. The result of all her own cause, no matter how regret and sad resentment was too late.</p>
<p>The world's most remote distance is not life and death, but I stand before you, you do not know that I love you</p>
