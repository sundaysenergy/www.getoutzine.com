<p>The Fang Weijia like square purple, and have had ten years' time.<br />
Who you love to deviate from the junior high school is students. The only time she for Fang Weijia is concerned, but is a symbol - the age of first place in each exam. Unshakeable.<br />
Square purple is not a few people in the classroom Baotuan ramble about who ran to the store to buy a bunch of snacks; would not eat with yi duo does not care at all the boys in front of large pieces; not see handsome boys after when saliva will flow down.<br />
She was not like other girls so simple and frivolous - but it also means nothing.<br />
Is this party purple when the first two days, but the two <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/houston-texans-andre-johnson-jersey-c-251_265.html">Andre Johnson Jersey</a> boys in class fights play tables and chairs flying the occasion, opened two people, stunned thrown three meters far. Everyone stunned, she has slowly return to the position, are like that did not happen.<br />
Fang Weijia froze in place, I thought, square purple, it really is an interesting person. Since the other purple began to pay special attention to.<br />
Although it is a concern, but there is no further action. Fang Weijia can do at the time, only in night classes maintain order when it is his turn, was silent. Or her do the blackboard was the other naughty boys making things difficult, with a very small, but enough that we can hear the voice said: "Yes, ah, very good."</p>
<p>Maintain this status, and to ascend school high school until the square purple and direct their own.</p>
<p>The square purple points in the next class of Fang Weijia, or unshakeable <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/houston-texans-matt-schaub-jersey-c-251_264.html">Matt Schaub Jersey</a> pestle in age position. The angry masses from the nickname, called "the test, you die Mieko", referred to as "Mieko. Every time I hear people talk privately, Fang Weijia heart, actually to, as if to say to yourself.<br />
To realize that like her, do th power purple appendicitis surgery not come to school for a whole week.<br />
Equal to seven days a week, equal to 168 hours, equal to 10,080 minutes, equal to 604,800 seconds, that is to say, the entire 604,800 seconds did not see the square purple.</p>
<p>Fang Weijia restless.<br />
He did not dare to go to the hospital to see her, that <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/houston-texans-arian-foster-jersey-c-251_257.html">Arian Foster Jersey</a> time he was sensitive and arrogant, unwilling to admit the feelings of the other purple, but the fact is, and bones feel square purple not like yourself?</p>
<p>She is then a perfectionist. I heard once Zhongkaomoni out 780 points, square purple Score is 760 points also crying a girls ... so the pursuit of perfection, how would choose love before the University, how would fall in love with Fang Weijia it?</p>
<p>Fang Weijia discretion over and over again, I feel so silent love go to do their best for her, just think they pay at the same time feel happy, did not return, what is the relationship it?<br />
Fang Weijia And she secretly told myself, must be admitted to the same university and square purple go.<br />
Since then, Fang Weijia will see in the school bike shed where her car to not, when it rains, <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/atlanta-falcons-matt-ryan-jersey-c-21_23.html">Matt Ryan Jersey</a> worried that she did not bring rain gear, carefully selected birthday gift ...</p>
<p>Then they exchange only after meeting with a gently "Hi" or "so early", "had left ah" and the like. Fang Weijia terms of great satisfaction. He collected and saved to memory and square purple and purple together party, has become his life plan, they are like a lying Travel, he was ready with all equipment prior to travel.<br />
Time goes by fast, has not remember the countless struggling refresher overnight, do not remember how many square purple name in a pad of paper to write, that the Fang Weijia power, she supported, so do not give up, will end, and The square purple admitted to the same university.</p>
<p>Began to get the admission notice to the <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/atlanta-falcons-roddy-white-jersey-c-21_34.html">Roddy White Jersey</a> university first met four years of college, until to follow her to the company now - Fang Weijia have intentionally or unintentionally, the other side Purple has been revealed, but she was always evasive, did not promise not refuse .</p>
<p>He began doing odd jobs along from the big to do tutoring, home loans, to participate in the work of this year, only 20,000 did not pay off.</p>
<p>He had this fantasy with her design room decoration, furniture, curtains style ... he knows she likes photography, portrait photography so hard study, who she filmed more than a hundred or stunning or lady photos; When she graduated, He spent a huge effort to modify her thesis; him know <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/atlanta-falcons-tony-gonzalez-jersey-c-21_35.html">Tony Gonzalez Jersey</a> that she likes to eat sweet and sour pork, he does not hesitate to go to a restaurant to work a month for free ...</p>
<p>In the case of no return for her after we have done far more relatives, but also much more than the boyfriend thing.<br />
A full decade.<br />
For her, he had declined too much Referrals. She lives in his heart, he is definitely not allowed to come in the second person.<br />
There were two boys to pursue her, not long after, they turned against him. At the time, he innocently felt victory in sight again to square purple confession.</p>
<p>- "Oh, ah, hey, today's coffee seems to pale a bit." Face faint smile.<br />
"Square purple, I ..."<br />
"Some say it today, I do not want to say this." Turned his head waiter, pay the bill. "<br />
- Every time, easily her escape the past. Fang <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/baltimore-ravens-torrey-smith-jersey-c-36_55.html">Torrey Smith Jersey</a> Weijia because prepare for too long, so the more kiasu think this answer is better than directly reject better.</p>
<p>However, so many years, he was a bit tired. Even be some hatred. Hatred no place to vent when he will no longer call her. Do not go cheap Baba gave her soup meal delivery. The work also refused to speak to her.</p>
<p>Whenever he deliberately alienate her, she took the initiative to come to him, and take the initiative to tell jokes, and even bought his favorite mango tarts.</p>
<p>But when he re-raised with her, she evaded my question him, Fang Weijia even interrupted the parts are not.</p>
<p>Day also all mortgage Fang Weijia thoroughly, give her a call, and asked her to accompany their cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>This time, regardless of how that he must seize the opportunity - regardless of how she Dodge, so many years, always one of the off we go.<br />
April gorgeous park, cherry positive joy.</p>
<p>Went to park the depths of green grass next to a bench, a little tired, they sat down side purple.</p>
<p>He finally got the courage and said: "purple party, <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/baltimore-ravens-terrell-suggs-jersey-c-36_48.html">Terrell Suggs Jersey</a> this is my last confession to you, if you are willing, we will have together."</p>
<p>Entire park seemed to quiet down, he heard his own nervous gasps: "If you do not, you're asking me directly, perhaps, so you and I, are better."</p>
<p>A long time, he finally heard him say: "I'm sorry," she said: "Fang Weijia, I'm sorry, I ... I have tried many times, but you are not the man of my dreams."</p>
<p>On this day, after all.</p>
<p>He does not know what she later said, just to feel that they seem to have been thrown into a full vacuum glass house, can not hear any sound. The hustle and bustle of the world, coming and going, the whole has nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>Shaoxing Opera "Dream of Red Mansions", a libretto: "heavens corner Nu Wa, heart missing a corner of difficult complement." He is the kind of situation strike.</p>
<p>Please units a week off. After a holiday, he suddenly figured out. Thought to want to, simply asked a friend to help him handle the resignation formalities - Now that really can not be on the road with her, then, simply completely no intersection it.</p>
<p>A year later, Fang Weijia encountered wife now Kazuhiko. <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/baltimore-ravens-ray-rice-jersey-c-36_42.html">Ray Rice Jersey</a> Her temperament frank, generous, very pretty, the two talked very speculative, he did not take long to fall in love quickly.</p>
<p>Before registering, he remembered it, always felt, said Kazuhiko a clear, regarded as fair. He is also stored with selfish, he wanted to test the next Yan a mind, to see what she can tolerate before he is so obsessed; Second, just ask an outsider, to help him analyze the next year why pay so much to get it It is so painful outcome.</p>
<p>Him something about, Kazuhiko a long time did not speak. Fang Weijia patted her shoulder, "how? Would not be angry? Hey, that's all a thing of the past." Kazuhiko looked, he saw her Red Eye's eye socket, a moment at a loss, "Yan ... how do you? "Yan a hand over his eyes, a little embarrassed, After a child, she said:" Fang Weijia, you are the most stupid people in the world love so hard, I am pained you ... "</p>
<p>He hesitated, and could not guess her words true and false.</p>
<p>Kazuhiko one and then said: "I think just the girls too shenanigans. Give you an analogy, is like waiting for a bus, she bent luxury bus, but coming and going all the small public, take a small public it she can not be reconciled, but luxury bus has not appeared, anyway, have been waiting for a long time, simply wait, do not believe the bus does not come. If you mind taking a small public, such as why not start sat a small public? say in case boarded a small public bus then how to do? "<br />
"...... Is this it? Turned me in her eyes, just a small public ah." Tastes too uppermost once missing corner of the heart at the moment is yin, a blow open his heart began Sese pain.</p>
<p>Kazuhiko said: "you do not love the experience, do not know <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/baltimore-ravens-ed-reed-jersey-c-36_39.html">Ed Reed Jersey</a>  that the pursuit of a girl is limited to a maximum of one year, more than a year still can not get her heart, then she is definitely not suitable for you?"</p>
<p>"It's no one to tell me this."</p>
<p>"It was the young thing ... can be understood., However, you do not pay so much she does return, you do not care?"</p>
<p>"I think if you love someone, is not asking for anything."</p>
<p>Kazuhiko a sudden laugh, like a love expert, he said: "I tell you, unrequited love is love, called Fanjian However, having said that, every human life committed once cheap enough, young thing, naive, and just hold on to what you can change. "</p>
<p>Unrequited love, is love, called Fanjian. This sentence so that he awakened, he muttered to himself, even to utter a word.</p>
<p>See he does not speak, Kazuhiko one some distressed Banguo his neck, said: "So, infatuation must look for objects that some people are not worth paying too much and hurt their own people will not appreciate it, but it also do not blame you, because no <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/baltimore-ravens-joe-flacco-jersey-c-36_46.html">Joe Flacco Jersey</a> one can guarantee their love throughout no deviation so I forgive you. "</p>
<p>He barely smiled and nodded, Peng Guo Yan a face, heavy a kiss on the forehead.</p>
<p>Perhaps we have obsession for love, but that is definitely not our error. Everyone can not guarantee his love throughout not deviate from, but it can definitely guarantee when him find their own position, cherish.</p>
<p>Like the resignation of Fang Weijia, I believe that in the not far away, so a person waiting for him certainly, but he did not find her. In other words, the reason why he and the party purple are not together is because God in order to arrange for him to Kazuhiko encounter.</p>
