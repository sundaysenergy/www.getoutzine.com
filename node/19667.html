<p>It was a blind date arranged by friends. Year she was already 28 years old, love the flowers opened thanks, only because there is no pair of legs can walk, love is ultimately no ending sorrow, like a sharp sword to stab the heart of a fragile and sensitive full of holes. She could no longer Shoubu as pain, so a friend introduced him, she hesitated slightly, so I agreed.</p>
<p>His long her one-year-old, simple and honest honest, <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/san-francisco-49ers-vernon-davis-jersey-c-598_623.html">Vernon Davis Jersey</a> taciturn. When they meet, he sat stiffly across from her, a little shy, a pair of hands to move from the desktop to the knee, and from the knee to the desktop, the head kept oozing fine sweat. An hour, if they say no more than ten. After the parents asked her, she nodded nor shook his head, . This person, and her ideal man, a difference far more than a thousand miles? But the parents are happy, they say, the most reliable and this sedate honest man, you not be too hard to pick, almost on the line.</p>
<p>Very plain and exchanges, every few days, he <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/denver-broncos-peyton-manning-jersey-c-179_181.html">Peyton Manning Jersey</a> would make a phone call, not too much. Simple greeting. Before you put the phone, he always asked, like what to eat, when I went to bring you. She was silent, not answer him. Every other day when he came to hold a bunch of apples oranges kiwi. He said, you handle every computer, eat good on the eye, there will no superfluous words, stay in watching her hands flying on the keyboard with her practice "sit reactive.</p>
<p>She politely kept his distance, not pro not sparse, gentle. Sometimes he just call her friends, she will be delighted tease, Jiaohan Keren, different places, talk for twelve hours. After he put the phone still she immediately convergence from those who willfully indulge, they become gentle and elegant. He tried very hard to want to come into her heart, he once said: the poem "A Dream of Red Mansions" ... but she interrupted him, outside the rain? Her smile gentle, there refused <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/philadelphia-eagles-desean-jackson-jersey-c-502_503.html">Desean Jackson Jersey</a> him thousands of miles away the cold, that he could not close the distance. Her heart never made him open like clam closed.</p>
<p>In fact, she can go, except you'll use crutches. But she never walked in front of him, she was so proud, decidedly refused to expose defects in under his eyes. He also by her, pushing her to go shopping together, go to the bookstore, go to the flower market for her to buy a tasty roasted sweet potatoes.</p>
<p>On that occasion, when he came to, her day with a workout in the garden area. Her armpit hobble around on crutches, crutches Xianxiang forward, then the left leg forward step, stood still, the right leg and then step forward. Hobbled so hard every step. He looked, and my heart suddenly painful. She turned just in time to see him, his hand coming to help her, she blushed and firmly pushed him away and kept walking. No one walk a few steps, at the foot of a sudden a reel, the whole people fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, he darted from behind, legs kneeling on the ground, hands clinging to her waist. In the blink of an eye, his face oozing thick beads of sweat, his eyes full of affection and remorse. He asked Diesheng: hurt too much where? <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/philadelphia-eagles-lesean-mccoy-jersey-c-502_509.html">Lesean Mccoy Jersey</a> Does it hurt? To. I hold you up ... She was sitting on the ground, motionless, eyes staring at him. But fall, and this scene is not uncommon for her. But in front of this man, he's nervous, he's flawless, beads of sweat on his forehead, seems to have told her: he loves her and cares about her, feel for her, pity her.</p>
<p>She asked, you are so nervous why? He did not speak, blushing, laughing. At that moment, her heart suddenly very soft. She seemed to have heard own heart cavalry glaciers generally rumbling sound, all the ice melted.</p>
<p>She knew that her heart has been deviated from outside the orbit of the love. Tumble this fall, her love turning a corner, his love and distressed, and is a distinctive landmark of the corner, all the way to lead her into the orbit of love.<br />
The plum is my unrequited six girlfriend, September alma mater, I met her blooming. Became apparent, dressed in white dress set off her slim, standing in the wind as if a snow plum. Later, happened at the same table. Loving the same in tension while learning a happy life heaviest load days. She is a girl but cautious, such as hair, count the theme of scrap paper over, she would be timely to slips me a stack. Morning I just hit a sneeze afternoon, she was handing me a box <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/philadelphia-eagles-michael-vick-jersey-c-502_524.html">Michael Vick Jersey</a> of cold medicine. Each other talking and laughing together elated, once half a day but not will irritability restless, melancholy noticed the corner of the room and end up with a spider's web. We understand each other deeply into the other's inner world.</p>
<p>Love, refused silence may I dare not tell the truth, because I was a farmer's son, nothing, and she was born in the senior cadres of the family, that is a gulf between us. To cross this divide, my only recourse is to go to college. I certainly do not doubt their own strength, but this must be sacrificed. I only have the feelings are deeply embedded in the crust of the soul, turned into power gung ho. There is no commitment, no confession. This does not affect her concern for me passionately devoted.</p>
<p>Graduation, she gave me a special gift, I <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/philadelphia-eagles-jeremy-maclin-jersey-c-502_506.html">Jeremy Maclin Jersey</a> published the article clip. On the title page, she wrote: let me grow into a tree, standing you must pass through the intersection.</p>
<p>Later, she was admitted to a renowned Medical University in the provincial capital, and I bring pen Congrong a paper volunteer down the river, into a military academy. I thought that can be said to her: I love you.</p>
<p>However, his life for the Great Patriotic duty of a soldier, generosity went to the edge is the responsibility of the military. I can uncomplainingly stationed at the ends of the earth, but she did not, her tender shoulders how to lift the three miles to the wind and sand, 8,000 miles of the cloud and months?, How can bear to let her to endure life too more than too heavy load? Love is a romantic, marriage is mundane. I swallow this sentence.</p>
<p>University communications, full of frustration and bitterness, full of anticipation and sweet. We are no longer avoid talking about love, just be very careful to hide himself. Many times, she plaintively mentioned roommates in favor with Huhuashizhe is how the spring breeze, such as <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/seattle-seahawks-russell-wilson-jersey-c-627_630.html">Russell Wilson Jersey</a> bath dew. Only because she was lonely and Neilingding. A weekend, others are Flying, and she can only hide in deserted places together, calling my name over and over again to read my letter. She said that, alone as a nun, to the hearts of the gods, close all doors and windows, affix the label rejected other spring.</p>
<p>Full four years, each floating snow night, my dreams would come over her black pillow occasion Xiang. Love is immortal, as underground magma, out boiling surging conflict in an attempt to Duolu, repressed the longer, the more violent eruption. Despite her many kind invitation to the identity of the students go to see her, I did not go. Not without opportunity, every time I pass by their school. But I did not stop it through the window, I can only the affectionate <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/philadelphia-eagles-brent-celek-jersey-c-502_527.html">Brent Celek Jersey</a> glance cast ─ ─ I worried, when they meet magma will break through the crust prematurely.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old birthday, I received a gift her Post to: Sarah Chen's song with a box. I listen surprised to find, which left Sarah Chen that Ruqirusu, repeatedly calling: "Well, say you love me." Moment, I burst into tears, the impulse to pick up the phone, wanted to say: "Plum, I love you!" soldiers sanity interception this strand of pale tenderness.</p>
<p>Not GARRISON, I swear, certain non-Mo she married.</p>
<p>Four years of university life is finally over, I really points back to the provincial capital. With trembling fingers, I immediately called the phone, and told her the news. The hair a Shen Break ─ ─ addition to shortness of breath. Got his wish, and I think she must be excited speechless. Phrase in oral collision thousands of times, then just blurted out when she interrupted me, infinitely sad and infinitely fondly said these words, she has been waiting for six years, and so good bitter. Only this time I was late, she has accepted that boys have patience. His only better than I am, is the ─ ─ brave, bold hugs she would only say the sound: ILoveyou. But this has been enough, and that sound dream seemed distant mountains and seas Call, opened her deep emotional door closed, warm heart and flowers a woman drying time. Here she has been crying. Six years of unrequited build emotional foundation is an "I love you" hit pieces!</p>
