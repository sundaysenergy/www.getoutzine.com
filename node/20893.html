<p>Article found in a friend's space inside, reading feeling very deep, In fact, I feel like I've been others good as it should be, so you can rightly say some strange words, and I intend to own since convergence, think more of him good, good to get along with him, maybe he is a person over a lifetime and I.<br />
The feeling of love, always in the beginning when sweet, I <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/clay-matthews-jersey-c-9.html">Clay Matthews Youth Jersey</a> felt much more a stay by more than one person to help you share, you finally no longer alone, because at least one person thinking of you, loving you, whether anything, as long as we can be together, that is good.</p>
<p>The feeling of love, then you are home, but slowly, with the deepening of the understanding that you will find each other's shortcomings, so the problem one by one, so you start trouble, tired, or even want to escape.</p>
<p>Some say love is like picking up rocks, always want to pick a suitable own. However, how you know when to pick up? He is right for you, and you for him?</p>
<p>In fact, I think that love should be like grinding Dan Zier, perhaps when you're just starting to pick up, not so satisfied, slowly, everything will change. Because people are resilient, many things can be changed, as long as you are determined to have the courage and its unknown stone everywhere to pick up, not as good as they already have stone polished polished.</p>
<p>Many people think that because the feelings <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/eli-manning-jersey-c-10.html">Eli Manning Youth Jersey</a> faded, people would become lazy people is inert to conquer, and then slowly fades feelings. Now more and more people just want to talk about a lifetime of love, has refused marriage. Because, marriage easy to become lazy.</p>
<p>If everyone is too lazy speech, too lazy to listen, too lazy to create surprise, too lazy to tenderness between husband and wife or lover, how will gradually become distant? Please remember: dynamic love, modest hospitality to irrigate. Love, is not lazy.</p>
<p>There was a couple, Meet after work to dining, shopping, but the girl was delayed because of the company's meeting, when her rain arrived 30 minutes late, her boyfriend is very upset and said: "Every time you are so now I feel no, I'll never wait for you out! "Suddenly, the girl's heart collapsed, she thought: Perhaps they no longer future.</p>
<p>However, in this place, another couple is also facing the same problem, but her boyfriend says: "I think you <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/joe-flacco-jersey-c-11.html">Joe Flacco Youth Jersey</a> must be busy, right?" Then he wiped away the girl face of rain, and take off his jacket Phi in the body of the girl, at the moment, the girl in tears. But the flow of her tears on my face was warm and happy.</p>
<p>Perhaps, hate only in us an idea! Love, not only to understand tolerance more timely, a lot of things may just be that changing your mind fills. If someone loves you, and you also think he is good, that does not mean you would choose him.</p>
<p>We always said: "I am looking for a love of people will love." But when the other asked you considered how to love, but you can not answer him, because you do not know.</p>
<p>Yes, we always thought we would find a love love. But later, when we suddenly look back, only to discover what they once naive. If never started, how do you know she will love love that person? Or love the feeling to be together experienced a lot of things would not discover.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to find their own minds of one hundred percent of the partner, but you have not thought about you earlier someone you quietly pay for a long time, but you do not find it.</p>
<p>So, still a closer look at the people <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/matt-ryan-jersey-c-12.html">Matt Ryan Youth Jersey</a> around he might have been waiting for you a long time. When you love someone, love to just eight absolute good. All the expectations and hopes are only Qi Bafen the remaining two or three points to love yourself. If you continue to love more, is likely to cause the other a heavy pressure, so that each breath, it completely lost the love of fun.</p>
<p>Drinking more than six drunk, eat no more than seven full, love a person when no more than eight. Just right.</p>
<p>Love a person, to understand but also open solution; want to apologize but also thanks; want to admit also error correction; want to be understanding and considerate; accept rather than endure; tolerant and not condoned; support, not dominate; is condolences not questioned; talk, not a complaint; memorable but not forgotten; communicate with each other and not be accountable in all things; quietly praying for each other and not to the many other requirements. Can be romantic, but do not waste, do not casually hand, not to let go lightly.<br />
Memories, we are very happy with his day together. However, since people have the grass is always greener, I also why refuses to let go? I am a long spit of breath: "all you mean to do it. Was this scourge can be led away from me, I really appreciate it." He looked at me in surprise and he knows I'm not a Cardiothoracic open-minded woman.</p>
<p>"In fact, I have you fatigued." I see light as a feather, we do not expect that he is still in my mind Taishan.</p>
<p>He feels guilty, decided to home all left me and the kids.</p>
<p>Before the divorce, he was about to have dinner with me. A few drinks, him to open up, he said, hoping to get <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/matt-schaub-jersey-c-13.html">Matt Schaub Youth Jersey</a> my blessing. He also took the initiative to talk about the girl, her vibrant, with her, he had the feeling of being ignited. Remembered that he is also young, beautiful, vibrant, and has also been as attractive to him, and me with that woman, but separated by years time, he was clearly labeled old love and new love labels.</p>
<p>"She was very naive, little little things can make her feel satisfied, for example, to go shopping with her, raffle got a piece of soap; electronic form to send her a 20 yuan; took her to eat dumplings; bought her a soil residue child cake ...... she will be ecstatic with her, I'm relaxed, I can house an smoke smokes, I can also play overnight mahjong with friends Pinjiu ... "he revel in their own happiness where wavefront gentle.</p>
<p>I like all Huanglian Po, on a budget, to say in his expense should shop around and buy a pair of socks. I would not allow him to smoke, prohibit him from drinking more against him shout three drink four places gambling.</p>
<p>Her, I feel the heart beat faster, doing full force. "He obviously has been a bit tipsy.</p>
<p>I interrupted him: "Since then, I no longer your Huanglian Po, is no longer a servant you do not have to pay wages. I can save you Ironing with tie of time, to dress themselves; N practice, save you money to buy clothes, to pick their own fashion show for a few <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/michael-vick-jersey-c-14.html">Michael Vick Youth Jersey</a> pieces; I can not have the brains to search fish do not have to please your stomach and want to eat I do not want to cook, I can take my daughter to eat fast food; I no longer have to worry about you smoking lung injury, alcohol liver injury; I do not have to wash your sheets vomited mess, do not you drunk wine, sleeping in the street a corner, crying one side filled to find; I do not have to worry about your home of relatives who hold a birthday party today, tomorrow who marry a wife; no longer need to give your parents a month to send the cost of living; without an annual half-day car ride with you, carrying bags to go more than 10 in the mountain, dinner, dinner only to accompany your parents ... ah, divorce, really great! "That said, I burst into tears, while he looked Leng Leng I.</p>
<p>I have always appeared very calm, but a little bit of alcohol put my heart betrayed. 31-year-old woman, who do not mind their own business for many years of marriage?</p>
<p>I laughed it: "from the right, from the look you can be proud of how long you <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/patrick-willis-jersey-c-15.html">Patrick Willis Youth Jersey</a> very much love her, right? She also very much love you, right? Come together, living together for several years, you will not see her rapid heart beat. she give you are ten years ago, I gave you, you toss will find you toss enough, you just take us through the road and repeat again.</p>
