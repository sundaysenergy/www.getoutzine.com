<p>He fell in love with her because word. That day, the unit held a dinner. They are arranged in the same table. Dish, everyone on the liberation of the mouth to speak, followed by the sound of the house are full of contented chewing; last meal up a fish-flavored pork, she exclaimed, <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/roddy-white-jersey-c-23.html">Roddy White Youth Jersey</a> delicious, enjoying it eat rice really did not rule : he laughed involuntarily looked at her more glances. She met his eyes said: Really, I must learn to do this dish at home is a wonderful feeling many in than go to a restaurant to eat: he was very touched: Today, girls mostly spoiled back Pareto afraid detrimental face away from the kitchen stove, so he likes having thought very disappointed combined - since - and this can be regarded as a warm home? At this time, some people had already left, she had to speak wasted time still there slowly eat; he slowed down, put down the chopsticks caught out after she finished.</p>
<p>Their love blossomed in this moment bloom.</p>
<p>And is in close contact to know each other. This is a very easy thing for them. In the same unit, do with each other deep down there is no presence of each other, the other is what people naturally do not mind. Now it's different, they are <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/russell-wilson-jersey-c-24.html">Russell Wilson Youth Jersey</a> pleasantly surprised to find that the original partner in sight you. He is a farmer's son. She is a daughter of the Secretary. But this is what hinder it? They all think, If you love all this as a reference, it is tasteless and very. Even so, he still sometimes think she was born so, but not as arrogance, is really commendable. Her a long time ago I heard that he is a genius, upon contact, really deserved reputation. She wanted, and this person over a lifetime, but also worthwhile.</p>
<p>Soon they love being.</p>
<p>On this day, he went to her house for dinner. <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/tim-tebow-jersey-c-25.html">Tim Tebow Youth Jersey</a> This is a required course for every Sunday. He entered the room, sat - a moment, the girl's father received - a phone call. Then he said, at noon today, me and your aunt in a hurry to do lunch arranged by both of you looked at it. He was pleased to be down like this - will be able to enjoy the meals she made. Unexpectedly, she suggested to go to a restaurant to eat; he said shaking his head, I do not want to go to a restaurant, I want to learn what you do flavored pork. She looked down, I have not learned: he could not believe his ears, and do what she just lip?, He said, that you will do what dish? Her weary, say, there is no need at home I cook, I will not: he was a bit off guard, although this is long overdue think. He said, that you've lied to me! Girl shortness of breath roared What did I lie to you? I know you, you said what I said a lie? He could not answer. It simply is not a commitment, just a dream <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/tom-brady-jersey-c-26.html">Tom Brady Youth Jersey</a> of creating their own. Kind of a deep sense of family atmosphere, and always his dream that never withers poetic. Now, he was breaking the sentence. He was speechless, a long time, you do not fool me, I have been lying to myself.</p>
<p>Lunch that day, they did not eat it broke up.</p>
<p>Night, toss and turn, can not people sleep. The next day, she did not come to work, gave <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/victor-cruz-jersey-c-31.html">Victor Cruz Youth Jersey</a> him a phone call, we break up! He blurted, no. She said, my dishes are not done, you and I together, what does that mean?, He said, according to this standard, I should find a chef, right? She laughed silently at the end of the line, then sighed and said, do not be boring, anyway, after I ignore you it wants.</p>
<p>Soon, he was palpable on the knot of marriage. <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/tony-gonzalez-jersey-c-27.html">Tony Gonzalez Youth Jersey</a> He became a logistical Minister swept almost all of the housework. She sometimes learn to do things, but always do it very well, then simply let go of all. For this, he did not complain. Fact that insomnia night he wanted good: fish-flavored pork was good, but, after all, is a dream; Now that dream has been broken, it is better to wake up and get down to let his wife do a love a happy man.<br />
My wife is a woman like vows, she often intentionally or unintentionally encouraged me swear I almost trained to face lie to the players. Originally, I was one spoke very objective man, even in love, is not willing to say no sensible. Before I got married, I was forced to swear to never, ever love her, otherwise she would strike feast ", you know this is our Wedding Banquet! Opened this precedent, I vows began to have a certain understanding, since she was glad to hear, I mid-month, every day to speak. As long as she was not happy washing dishes, I said the words, she happily in the kitchen busy as; as long as she did not want to copy is issued, I say these words, her spirit of times to sit at the table for me Transcription "stinking" manuscript.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, after many years of marriage, the woman vows there will be a clear understanding of which <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/tony-romo-jersey-c-28.html">Tony Romo Youth Jersey</a> are no longer keen, but my wife was bored. Now do not me "love you forever and ever," the oath, because also know that the "broad-minded" man now able to accommodate more than one person's love, so she put my the oath changed to "love you" I read this I did not take the initiative heartfelt vows total like in the back lines, "back" was a botch, back for a long time also blurted.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the wife of a sudden impulse, hot hair, go home, I can not help but laugh when asked: "off from where?" Her to maintain 10 years of pure hair, especially charming fringe, have become distant past . Around her colleagues, friends agreed that this "cauliflower-new hair does not look good, honest" I do not like. ", She was aggrieved and said:" Other people say does not look good it does not matter, how <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/torrey-smith-jersey-c-29.html">Torrey Smith Youth Jersey</a> can you say beautiful? "I see her this emotional develop necessary bedridden, corrected himself and said:" Look habits, will look good, I swear, good-looking and does not look good, always love you! " her face soon enough looks. In a few days, a family and friends said to me: "I thought your aesthetic ability is very high, and this is how to help the wife of General Staff hairstyle? Really bad!" I never thought that I must endure every day the wife of an explosion hairstyle , but also to suffer in silence my aesthetic "reputation" of the <a href="http://www.nflyouthjerseyshop.com/troy-polamalu-jersey-c-30.html">Troy Polamalu Youth Jersey</a> accused, the end of the day has not dared to object to the results of the reform of the wife's hair. Recently, his wife often dressing table asked me: "What kind of hair look good a thing!" I said: "Yes, yes, I swear I always love your hair!"</p>
<p>Hear a lot of my vows, his wife seems the future is full of confidence, so I started to explore since my past. Day, she agreeable to me said: "you know from your early poetic works have romance other than myself, if I promise to let bygones be bygones, Can you tell me about this?</p>
