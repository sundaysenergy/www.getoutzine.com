<p>The first day of her report to the company, the human resources department, he is responsible for the reception. See handsome appearance, brimming with boundless enthusiasm, her mind such as fleeting flying over this person this is a once in a dream met N times that.</p>
<p>He she seems to have some special attention. Sure enough, he was always working to create all conditions to help her with her bright, will soon come to the fore in a couple of new.</p>
<p>That Christmas night, about her tea. Yinyun tea, she wanted to let him know <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/houston-texans-andre-johnson-jersey-c-251_265.html">Andre Johnson Jersey</a> that she has been quietly in love with him, just to thank him for his help in the last six months, but can then export. The touches he generously said, "to help her because I like her." Kind of sweet in her mind they watch.</p>
<p>With the mind, any news of her special attention to succession learned from someone else's mouth, his family is a rare kind of superior, the father is the chairman of a listed company, the mother is the city's famous surgical doctor, and it is said that the future daughter-in-law requirements are particularly high, not only beautiful but also must have their own career. Know that, she was less immediately after the former calm. And he compared what is it? Parents are ordinary workers of a small town, cultured daughter of a college student is their greatest achievement. The gap between the two is too large. Itself, not the kind of soul intake amazing career better not do anything.</p>
<p>Love the threshold is too high, she is destined to take a step, however. She was glad that they did not promise him anything, or a love will die on the vine.</p>
<p>She is a girl of some scheming, consider again finally made up his mind how to do it. Began her intention to evade his gaze and pursue more to work, she believed that soon there will be a day to move the hearts of his and his <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/houston-texans-matt-schaub-jersey-c-251_264.html">Matt Schaub Jersey</a>  parents, with their own outstanding career, she believes her this capacity. Heart, he is still pursuing her, she always elude her more to the company, busy day.</p>
<p>Three months later, she was surprised to find together began obsessively pursuing him into the company to another girl Su. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union from the poor mountainous areas, parents are the rest of my life did not out of the mountain farmers continue their education in order to let the two younger siblings, the Soviet Union could only maintain a minimum standard of living in this city. Moreover, the Soviet Union looks just in general, so she really did not mind the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Once the company held a cocktail reception to celebrate his call so she must be going. Can order a single business, but she chose to accompany clients to dinner, cocktail party is said he could not find her some gaffe, drink a lot of wine, and finally the Soviet Union forcibly taken away almost drunk ......</p>
<p>During that time, she found, Su and his feelings suddenly close up, heart Daoke camel pain. But the consolation is that after six months because of a job well done, she was appointed as a department manager, became the youngest female middle managers in the company.</p>
<p>She finally got the courage to cross the threshold of her to find him, his confession actually been in love with him. He habitually looked at her fondly, but shook his head and said: "too late." Her heart instantly sank to the seabed. The first she knew his story and Su. The original after a drunken night, <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/houston-texans-arian-foster-jersey-c-251_257.html">Arian Foster Jersey</a> he was the Soviet Union back to the apartment, the Soviet Union is a girl the courage to pursue love and happiness, daring to tell the truth to his own hot love, he really touched by this humble girl. And six months Lysol simple goodness and dedication also impressed his parents.</p>
<p>At that moment, she suddenly understood the prince married to Cinderella, the princess married to flat head lad, love the original no threshold, while the so-called threshold but their own set of barrier<br />
Give up really is another kind of love? Give up is really another kind of happiness? Exact, to give up is the owner of another way! Embarrassed to quit, this is not great, but because I see between discharge and hold feelings can not be forced, it can not be forced to, even if I tightly grasp, seize what? Scars, is painful! Grip handle, nothing inside, release your hand, everything I have.</p>
<p>The most painful is hovering in that period between discharge and hold. Really determined to give up, but there will be a relieved feeling. Since then, the pain and love are deeply buried in my heart.</p>
<p>Life is so inevitable pain, it is inevitable injury, whether or not I had to seize or away, those things are not away from me, although some things can not look back some memories can not comb, some people can only be buried forever.</p>
<p>Fall in love with a man is a very troublesome thing, especially if you unknowingly for her to give up a lot <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/philadelphia-eagles-desean-jackson-jersey-c-502_503.html">Desean Jackson Jersey</a> of things for her to do a lot of things. But she died to insist on something final, refused to give up when you go into one hell of a bitter bitter. In particular, to the end she said, you are wrong, all of this is that you've asked for.</p>
<p>A lot of people can fall in love with one's life, and wait for you to get your own happiness, you will understand the previous waiver is kind of treasure, giving up makes you better to hold and cherish. Not because you get to think of, but because you are in their own living, so you have to learn to give up.</p>
<p>Give up is an art, it is not called the blind escape, but <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/washington-redskins-robert-griffin-iii-jersey-c-697_698.html">Robert Griffin III Jersey</a> want you to know pain to maintain might as well give up! Learn to give up, and walked away in tears before, leaving a simple back. Will be buried in the bottom of my heart yesterday, leaving the best memories. Learn to give up, so that each can have a more relaxed start, black and blue love does not necessarily memorable! Love a person, it is necessary to make him happy and make him happy, so that feelings more sincere. If you can not, let her go! Abandon it not another beautiful!</p>
<p>Hint of sunrise clouds cleared the Fuqin Sensation melodious Toru the sky overwhelmed thought worthy who knows longitudinal ruthlessly also love a lot of things, always will know how experienced. Such as feelings, the pain is over, will know how to protect themselves; silly too, <a href="http://www.nflauthenticjerseyshop.com/philadelphia-eagles-michael-vick-jersey-c-502_524.html">Michael Vick Jersey</a> will know how to insist on timely and give up, get lost in, we slowly understand their own. In fact, life does not need so many unnecessary persistent, nothing really can not let go. Learn to give up, life would be easier.</p>
